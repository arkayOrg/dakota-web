The ocean quahog is the oldest non-colonial marine species and poses singular challenges for sustainable management. Research emphasizes the population dynamics of these species and the influence upon them of global warming. A major component is the development of the first age frequencies for ocean quahogs to evaluate long-term recruitment trends. Growth rates are being used to examine the influence of warming bottom waters on clam physiology and productivity. Targeted surveys and data analysis of ongoing surveys are being used to identify the dynamics of range shifts and their affect on regulatory decisions. Development of a growth dataset for ocean quahogs is permitting reconstruction of the history of global warming since circa 1800. Implications include dramatic increases in stock rebuilding potential and the potential use of ocean quahogs as a bottom water proxy.</p><p>A research emphasis on forage fish is addressing the perception that forage fish quotas should be reduced to protect ecosystem services provided by these fish. Projects include addressing predator-prey relationships, documenting the basic population dynamics characteristics for chub mackerel, and development of a new survey design for Atlantic menhaden. The menhaden program has expanded to examine the effectiveness of dock-side monitoring of catch for both Atlantic and Gulf menhaden, and provision of important information on reproductive stage, movement and mortality from analysis of tagging data.</p><p>SCeMFiS has begun a series of studies designed to examine the influence of wind energy development on East Coast fisheries and vessel transit.</p><p>The marine mammal program has opened up a new topic area of research examining the management of grey seals in the U.S. Northeast.</p><p>Emphasis on the economics of the fishing industry includes economic evaluations of the scup, surfclam, Loligo squid, and summer flounder fisheries.</p>"

    field_research_focus: "<p>NGPV research involves all aspects of the entire value chain in the solar PV industry - from fundamental cell technologies, material science, multidisciplinary engineering and technologies, to the end user - in order to advance solar PV from being an alternative energy resource to becoming a widely utilized, mainstream source of electrical energy. The materials and device research encompasses all types of materials used in the solar PV industry, including industry-leading silicon and thin film cadmium telluride (CdTe) and emerging perovskite materials. One of NGPV's research strengths is its expertise on inexpensive thin film semiconductors that can be processed using high throughput schemes involving state-of-the-art gas phase and solution-based methods.

    field_overview: "<p>The Center for Net-Centric and Cloud Software and Systems (NCSS) performs basic research to completely restructure software and systems for networked and cloud computing environments.</p><p>There has been a shift in military and civilian services from platform-based systems, which work independently, to network-centric, integrated computing infrastructures for operating, for example, planes, ships and missiles. But current systems lack effective integration, which is detrimental to their availability, security, interoperability, and cost. Most contemporary approaches to net-centric software seek to \"patch\" the existing system. The patch solution makes interoperability even more complex. NCSS' goal is to upgrade net-centric software from the ground up.</p><p>NCSS research includes developing and verifying secure, resilient, and efficient software and hardware. As these applications will be available via networks, and since some of the most important applications will be time critical and potentially life-sustaining, the development of net-centric software demands flawless handling of security and dependability.</p><p>To achieve these goals, the Center's academic institutions bring complementary expertise in hardware systems, including emerging processing architectures and accelerators and memory technologies; service-oriented architectures, software service composition, and quality of service when running on net-centric and cloud computing systems; and communication systems, signal processing, and protocols.</p>"
    field_research_focus: "<p><strong>Emerging processing and memory technologies</strong><strong> </strong><br />NCSS has evaluated three organizations using 3D dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), and phase change memory (PCM): 3D DRAM as main memory; 3D DRAM as last-level cache; and 3D DRAM and PCM together as main memory. NCSS has characterized memory access behaviors of applications and designed technique to dynamically adapt the memory organization to the changing memory access behavior of applications. It has also explored embedding small processing elements on the logic layer of 3D stacked memories (that is, processing in memory, or PIM) and explored different types of processing architectures as PIM cores, including simple reduced instruction set computer architectures, reconfigurable dataflow architectures, and graphics processing unit. NCSS is evaluating these emerging technologies for their suitability for net-centric and common cloud-based applications.</p><p><strong>Good private cloud-based system architectures, using a goal-oriented approach </strong><strong> </strong><br />The fast-growing cloud computing paradigm makes it possible to use unprecedented amounts of computing resources at lower costs, and it provides other benefits such as fast provisioning and reliability. In designing a robust architecture for a cloud-based system that meets the goals of all stakeholders, the numbers, types, and layouts of devices must be factored in from the earliest stages of design. NCSS investigated a goal-oriented simulation approach for cloud-based system design whereby stakeholder goals are captured and, together with such domain characteristics as workflows, used to create a simulation model as a proxy for the cloud-based system architecture.</p><p><strong>Cloud security assessment, using an ontological approach </strong><strong> </strong><br />NCSS uses ontologies to capture both vulnerabilities and cloud system configurations, relying on a variety of sources for capturing vulnerabilities, including the National Vulnerability Database. By so doing, NCSS has developed tools that can be used to query about a given IT system configuration to evaluate the security posture of the system and propose mitigation techniques. NCSS also uses ontologies to capture security service level agreements (SSLAs) and privacy policies offered by service and infrastructure providers. Ontologies for SSLAs can be used to understand the security agreements of a provider, to negotiate desired security levels, and to audit the compliance of a provider with respect to federal regulations (such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).</p>"

    field_research_focus: "<p><em><strong>Application of distributed acoustic sensing to monitor microseismicity and velocity changes in the subsurface</strong></em><br />Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) is a sensor technology that is gaining momentum in the oil and gas industry, especially in monitoring faint earth tremors and seismic velocity changes induced by stress and fluid during fluid injection or extraction. An objective of this project is to use the Pasadena, Calif., DAS array as a platform to research how to deal with the challenges of using DAS data for monitoring.</p><p><em><strong>Experimental investigation of the interaction between fluids and failure of rock faults in shear</strong></em><br />Fluids are known to trigger a range of slip events spanning from a slow, creeping motion to dynamic earthquake rupture growth. GMG studies the interaction of fluids and faulting in a highly instrumented experimental setup capable of injecting fluid at various rates onto a 3D polymethyl methacrylate specimen's interface, mimicking a fault in the Earth's crust.</p><p><em><strong>Infrastructure system resiliency via ground deformation monitoring</strong></em><br />Landslides pose a major hazard to local communities and infrastructure systems. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, which is now acquired weekly from satellites with near-global coverage, can provide high-spatial resolution measurements of ground surface motion. GMG's goal is to assess how SAR images can be used in combination with conventional techniques to monitor ground deformation at millimeter-level precision and accuracy to help forecast landslides.</p><p><em><strong>Microseismic monitoring with deep learning</strong></em><br />This project is focused on developing an end-to-end microseismic monitoring workflow using deep neural networks. GMG develops and tests deep learning algorithms to detect and locate induced microearthquakes using, in particular, data from a deep geothermal well simulation. GMG also explores application to vertical component seismic surveys.</p><p><em><strong>Modeling deformation and seismicity due to fluid injections</strong></em><br />Pumping fluids in the subsurface produces deformation due to poroelastic and thermal effects. It can induce seismicity and affects transport properties of the medium. GMG aims to forecast and eventually control these effects for various applications, such as geothermal energy production and CO2 storage. GMG therefore develops new approaches to estimate fluids pressure, deformation, transport properties and forecast induced seismicity through a combination of data analysis, thermo-poroelastic stress modeling and reservoir modeling.</p><p><em><strong>Understanding conditions for stable/unstable fault slip induced by fluid injections</strong></em><br />When fluids enter an existing fault, they increase pore pressure and promote slip; however, to predict whether the resulting slip would be seismic or not, and how far induced earthquakes might reach, GMG needs detailed understanding of several mechanisms: the effect of pore pressure on fault stability; the effect of dilatancy and compaction on pore fluid; and changes in friction properties due to the presence of fluids. GMG develops numerical models to simulate and assess these effects.</p>"

Its mission is to advance fundamental and applied metamaterials research, development, and technology transfer through strong collaborations between industry and universities. <strong>There is strong industry interest in metamaterials, as they are being used to develop new or higher-performing optical, electronic, and acoustic devices. </strong></p><p>Metamaterials are patterned and/or composite materials that exhibit effective permittivity, permeability, or refractive index properties not found in nature. Their properties are commonly the result of resonant phenomena arising from the subwavelength-scaled elements forming those patterns or composites. The smaller these elements are with respect to the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation, the better the metamaterial satisfies effective medium criteria and the more accurately they can be treated as a genuinely new material. Such materials have the potential to provide index values - very large, less than unity, or negative - with broad applications.</p>"
    field_research_focus: "<p><strong>Active metamaterials</strong><br />CfM explores this rich area of fundamental research of metamaterial, which is characteristically defined by its active composition of the host material. \"Active\" refers to the material properties that exhibit either optical gain under pumping, strong material nonlinear properties, or both.</p><p><strong>Active metasurfaces</strong><br />Metamaterials researchers have developed novel metallic feature structures, metasurfaces, that allow for local control of the phase as an optical beam is transmitted through a surface. This project is investigating these metasurfaces using a low-cost, rapid-development approach to increase the efficiency of the refraction, develop designs that allow for pixilated arrays of flat lenses, and investigate tuning concepts that would allow for the steering of microwave and infrared beams.</p><p><strong>Design and fabrication of low-loss low-index optical metamaterials</strong><br />A new and rigorous theory that goes well beyond well-known mixing rules has been used to predict specific particle properties that would lead to a composite metamaterial having a desired refractive index, such as less than unity. Modeling based on this method and the development of processes and procedures to make and characterize coated nanoparticles are in progress.</p><p><strong>Infrared Mueller matrix imaging of dielectric metamaterials</strong><br />Recent advances in three-dimensional laser direct writing enable the fabrication of dielectric metamaterials composed of constituents with virtually arbitrary geometry at the nanometer scale. But analysis of such metamaterials in the infrared spectral range is still lacking. In this project, CfM uses variable angle of incidence ellipsometry and near normal incidence ellipsometry to characterize infrared metamaterials composed of subwavelength dielectric structures.</p><p><strong>Metasurface design</strong><br />This project is developing and validating a design tool for bulk metamaterials that considers coupling effects between nanostructures. It is based on a building block of resonators for each nanostructure referenced in a database to compile the desired design structure.</p><p><strong>Orbital angular momentum (OAM) fiber</strong><br />This project focuses on generating, detecting, and sorting OAM modes. In this project, CfM takes what it has learned in past projects combined with knowledge in the field of fiber gratings and aims to develop a fiber grating that filters for OAM mode.</p><p><strong>Sorting uniquely identical spherical resonators by light forces</strong><br />CfM is developing a disruptive technology of sorting microspheres with extraordinary high level of uniformity of their whispering gallery mode resonances. The proposed method is based on work done by CfM showing that a focused laser beam exerts optical force on microspheres traversing the beam. </p><p><strong>Terahertz (THz) metamaterials</strong><br />CfM has discovered that THz form-birefringence can be induced in subwavelength structures fabricated from methacrylates using stereolithographic fabrication. These results provide a new avenue for the fabrication of highly anisotropic THz metamaterials and their use for THz sensing and imaging applications.</p>"

The majority of these processes employ heterogeneous catalysts. Many of these supported metal catalysts, such as automobile catalytic converters, comprise nanoparticles of expensive metals like platinum and rhodium anchored in place on a stable, highly porous \"support,\" such as aluminum oxide. In a catalytic converter, toxic exhaust components of carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and unburnt hydrocarbons are adsorbed onto the surface of the metals, where they decompose and rearrange into benign products of carbon dioxide, water, and nitrogen. Since the metals are expensive, the nanoparticles are made as small as possible to get the most active surface per weight of metal. Without anchoring the metals on a support, the nanoparticles will coalesce at high temperature, rapidly diminishing the active surface and killing the catalytic activity.</p><p>The development of new or improved supported metal catalysts is a time-consuming and expensive process. The challenge CeRCaS is addressing is to understand the fundamental chemistry of synthesizing ultrasmall metal nanoparticles on supports, or - when two metals are needed as in a catalytic converter - how to place to the two metals in intimate contact to allow them to work together. These efforts will enable a more rational and streamlined approach to catalyst development across the wide range of industries that employ heterogeneous catalysts.</p>"

    field_overview: "<p>The Center for Advanced Subsurface Earth Resource Models (CASERM) seeks to transform the way geoscience data is used in the exploration and mining industry sector. Research at CASERM is focused on challenges in the development of 3D models for subsurface mineral resources, particularly as these models integrate diverse geoscience data to inform decision-making and minimize geological risk, beginning with locating and mining subsurface resources and continuing through mine closure and environmental remediation.</p><p>CASERM is a collaboration among industry, government agencies, and universities with the purpose of:</p><ul><li>Developing fundamental knowledge that transforms the way geoscience data is used to locate and characterize subsurface earth resources and, thus, to enhance exploration success, decrease prospect development time, and reduce overall spending.</li><li>Disseminating this knowledge to CASERM members.</li><li>Addressing the critical industry need for trained and prepared employees by educating future researchers, engineers, and scientists.</li></ul><p>Achieving this broad vision requires cross-disciplinary collaborations, including combining expertise in the traditional geoscience disciplines of mineralogy, geochemistry, petrology, economic geology, and geophysics with those in spatial statistics, inverse theory, numerical methods, computer science and high-performance computing, seismic imaging and inversion, tomographic imaging, and petrophysics.</p>"
    field_research_focus: "<p>CASERM conducts research in these topic areas: Development of novel instrumentation, analysis, and interpretation methods for enhanced characterization of rock properties; integration, scaling, and inversion of geological, petrophysical, and geophysical data types of dissimilar spatial resolution and distribution to identify and characterize subsurface resources; development of machine learning methods to predict subsurface properties, quantify uncertainty, and de-risk decision-making; and development of graphical and exploratory data analysis solutions and visualization tools for 3D subsurface features.</p><p><strong>Research focuses on:</strong></p><p><strong>Integrating sequential simulation methods with visual ensemble analytics for applications in the mining sector</strong><br />Mineral resource exploration results in large quantities of spatially referenced, multi-variate data sets. This project implements recent advances in Bayesian Visual Analytics (BaVA) to discover common attributes (geochemistry or mineral abundance) among features of interest within these multi-variate data sets. The BaVA framework combines the computational efficiency of machine learning with human cognition and expertise to rapidly identify spatial and parametric relationships that may remain hidden in traditional univariate or bivariate geostatistical analyses. Through collaborative case study analyses with CASERM member-partners, this project introduces BaVA methods for data visualization and analysis in the mining sector.</p><p><strong>Distal signatures and vectors of hydrothermal systems in carbonates</strong><br />Many hydrothermal deposits can be hosted in carbonate-rich wall rocks, including porphyry deposits and skarns, or have carbonates in the surrounding stratigraphy. Beyond the orebodies or massive replacement bodies the hydrothermal footprint continues in the carbonates, by spent fluids and producing weak signals, particularly along faults. This research defines the distal signatures of mineralizing fluids in carbonates, including mineralogical and textural signatures, geochemical signals in whole rock, vein coatings and carbonate minerals, stable isotopes, and fluorescence and cathodoluminescence features of carbonate minerals.</p><p><strong>Increasing the value of hyperspectral data</strong><br />Knowledge of both deposit mineralogy and the physical and mechanical properties of rock units is critical at many stages of project development. This project aims to use hyperspectral core scanning data to determine the quantitative mineralogy of drill core and to predict rock physical and mechanical properties. This multiyear project will involve identifying diagnostic features in hyperspectral spectra to identify the mineralogy using traditional automated mineralogy data for assessment; and finding relationships between the mineralogy derived from hyperspectral core scanning and petrophysical properties. The quantitative mineralogical and rock physical data obtained could then be used to build a 3D block model informing the cost of mining.</p><p><strong>Machine learning in resource modeling and mine planning</strong><br />Machine learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionize mining by advancing the technology of lofting in resource modeling and estimation. This approach can tap into the capabilities of ML algorithms to integrate Big Data, uncover hidden relations, and make predictions. Improved accuracy in predicting orebody shapes and quantifying uncertainties translates into monetary value through increased reserves or avoiding wasted mining operation based on false predictions.</p><p><strong>Seismic and radar high-resolution 3D mapping of fractures, geologic structure, and petrology beyond the mined volume</strong><br />CASERM is developing high-resolution and cost-effective geophysical imaging methods that can be applied within the mine. Targets are mine safety and ground control on the daily to monthly scale; mine planning on the monthly to annual scale and longer-term mine expansion; and temporal monitoring of permeability pathways for groundwater flow, such as for hydrothermal energy, wastewater or carbon dioxide disposal, and in situ leach mining, a mining process used to recover minerals through boreholes drilled into a deposit.</p>"

    field_research_focus: "<p><strong>Integrated pest management</strong><br />The integration of multiple pest management methods (known as integrated pest management) is a proven but infrequently adopted strategy for sustainable pest suppression, in part because results can vary depending on many factors. Inconsistent efficacy of a given management strategy may be resolved by further research into the biology of a given pest and modeling for increased understanding of the ecology of the cropping system, resulting in recommendations for improved management. For example, understanding of insect dispersal and reproductive capacity is key to accurate modeling of resistance development and its likely rate of spread from a point of origin.</p><p><strong>Methods and tools</strong><br />Limitations associated with methodology or tools commonly restrict research required for the development or full exploitation of pest control strategies. For example, cell lines for primary pest species are often lacking, with existing cell lines offering limited benefit. In addition, novel tools such as nanoparticles are under investigation for the delivery of bioactives for pest control.</p><p><strong>Physiology</strong><br />Increased understanding of a variety of physiological processes could provide the foundation for novel approaches to insect pest control (e.g., the movement of proteins across the insect gut into the hemocoel), or define key physiological challenges associated with control of a given pest (e.g., the digestive enzymes of stink bugs). In many organisms, including arthropods, introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) results in specific inactivation of an endogenous gene with sequence identity to the introduced dsRNA, a process known as RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi provides for the development of target-specific management methods for insect pests. Application of dsRNA knocks down genes in some arthropod species, and the practical application of this approach for arthropod control has been demonstrated. However, <em>research is needed to delineate factors that limit the application of RNAi</em><em> <em>to certain arthropods,</em></em> to fully exploit the potential of this new approach.</p><p><strong>Resistance</strong><br />The use of classical chemical insecticides was a major contributing factor to the increase in agricultural productivity in the 20th century, and insecticide application is still the primary management practice for most arthropod pests. However, repeated application of chemicals almost invariably results in development of resistance in the targeted pest, with insecticide resistance already documented in more than 500 species of insects and mites. As a result, a wide variety of chemicals effectively employed in the past are no longer useful against many pest species. The repeated use of any pest management tool, including transgenic plants expressing insect-specific toxins derived from <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em>, entails a very high risk of bringing about resistance. <em>There is a pressing need to find new approaches to manage pests that are resistant to current management approaches.</em></p>"

Existing machine-learning techniques fall short when applied to systems with many ports, which contain reliability hazards and have nonlinear responses and variability. There is an unmet need for models, methods, and tools that enable fast, accurate design and verification while protecting intellectual property. A behavioral approach to systems modeling will meet this need. CAEML develops new domain-specific machine-learning algorithms to produce models using limited training data. Designers' knowledge is used to speed up learning and impose physical constraints on the models.</p><p>CAEML pioneers the application of emerging machine-learning techniques to microelectronics and microsystems modeling. CAEML collaborates with microelectronics industry partners, whose products include electronic design automation tools, integrated circuits, mobile systems, and hardware for cloud computing.

    field_overview: "<p>The Center for Advanced Design and Manufacturing of Integrated Microfluidics (CADMIM) develops advanced design tools and manufacturing technologies for integrated microfluidics. Its mission is to advance research and education on the science, engineering, and applications of integrated microfluidic design and scalable production to develop low-power, automated, self-contained, mass-produced microdevices capable of multistep biochemical assessments.</p><p>CADMIM's goal is to support cost-effective, quick, and easy diagnosis of conditions in<br />the environment, agriculture, and food and water supplies, ultimately to protect human health and safety. For example, developing new medicines requires the efficient screening of millions of compounds, feeding a growing population demands faster breeding and testing of crop varieties, and protecting water supplies or beaches requires rapid lab results for ocean and urban runoff assays. In each of these areas, fluidic samples must be analyzed quickly, accurately, and at the lowest possible cost per test. CADMIM's strategy centers on mass-produced diagnostic devices equipped with microfluidic components: chip-sized devices with high sensitivities and short reaction times of one minute or less that are capable of chemical analyses in miniaturized volumes. </p><p>CADMIM focuses on three research areas that are intellectually intertwined. The ultimate challenge is to simultaneously innovate in all these areas to refine on-chip functions; ensure compatibility and connectivity; integrate intelligence and communication; anticipate, overcome, or circumvent bottlenecks; and create high-capability, self-contained, manufacturable microdevices. This is a fresh approach to microfluidic biochip development, designed to dramatically reduce cost with equal or superior performance to lab-based functionality, allowing for low-cost manufacture and widespread deployment. </p>"
    field_research_focus: "<p><strong>Integration and control systems</strong><br />Integration combines basic science with the implementation of sensing, analysis, and detection in manufacturable biochips and includes the development of interfaces to manage and communicate results. Options include a visual readout, such as a color change on the chip that can be read by the naked eye or digitally photographed and uploaded to the internet, or an electrical signal that can be interfaced to a smartphone or transmitted via a USB interface to a laptop computer. CADMIM researchers are also investigating the production of biochips with on-command, intelligent, programmable diagnostics that can perform multiple tests at the same time.</p><p><strong>Manufacturable processes and materials</strong><br />Many materials used for microfluidic devices are not suitable for large-scale production, and several manufacturable processes have yet to be explored for the production of low-cost microfluidic chips. Automated roll-to-roll methods for tape-based plastic hot embossing, paper printing, and thin-film metal lamination (e.g., flexible circuit technology), commonly used in consumer products, can all be adapted for lab-on-a-chip production. These processes can be merged to create a new class of mass-produced diagnostic devices.</p><p><strong>Sample processing and detection</strong><br />No group has attempted to jointly address long-standing issues in the microfluidics field in the context of mass-produced, low-cost, disposable, easy-to-use diagnostics. Innovation in sample filtering, constituent enrichment and separation, on-chip reagent storage, and fluidic functions (such as metering, mixing, and transport) in low-cost manufacturable biochips are some of the critical aspects for self-contained labs-on-a-chip. Innovation must also occur at the assay and detection level, such as the development of simplified cellular and molecular assays, tests that implement different transduction mechanisms (e.g., optical, mechanical, magnetic), and probes that are specifically designed to enable cheap disposable microfluidic platforms with more complex functions.</p>"

    field_research_focus: "<p>The MAST Center provides a unique opportunity to develop new membranes designed for targeted separation of industrial relevance. Its research program is divided into four broad areas:</p><p><strong>Biopharmaceutical processing</strong><br />Membrane-based unit operations are attractive for the purification of human therapeutics, as processing conditions are usually mild and scale-up of modular membrane units is straightforward. The MAST Center has significant expertise in developing advanced ultrafiltration processes, validating clearance of contaminants such as host cell proteins and DNA as well as FDA-recommended model virus particles. The MAST Center is also investigating the use of membrane-based separation processes for the purification of virus vectors, vaccines, and new gene therapies. Other applications of membranes in the biopharma area include microfiltration for use with perfusion bioreactors, membrane filters for sterilizing buffers and final product, and ultrafiltration for concentration and buffer exchange as part of the final formulation.</p><p><strong>Chemical separations</strong><br />Membranes are finding growing applications in non-aqueous phase separations such as the recovery of organic solvents, fractionation of organic chemicals, contaminant removal, and recovery of dissolved solutes from organic phases. Development of new organic solvent resistant membranes is essential for these applications. Other research areas include barrier membranes that could be used as protection against chemical warfare agents. Besides liquid separations, the MAST Center also has significant expertise in membranes for gas phase separations.<br /><br /><strong>Membrane fundamentals</strong><br />MAST Center focuses on developing new membranes with unique micro- or nanoscale structures and distinctive transport properties for emerging separation processes. In addition, tailoring the surface properties of membranes using advanced surface modification methods enables very fine separations while reducing the rate of membrane fouling, which is one of the critical factors governing the successful commercial application of membrane technology. The MAST Center also focuses on understanding membrane transport and fouling fundamentals using complementary modeling and simulations tools. Leveraging the range of equipment at the four participating universities provides accurate characterization of these new membrane structures.</p><p><strong>Water purification</strong><br />Water is a very valuable natural resource. Recovery, recycle, and reuse of water are essential to meet the increasing societal demands. The MAST Center is investigating emerging membrane technologies for treatment of produced water from oil and gas manufacturing operations as well as the treatment of wastewaters from food or agricultural production processes. MAST Center researchers are developing novel membranes and membrane processes for direct potable reuse of wastewaters. Besides treating agriculture and aquaculture wastewaters, the MAST Center is also focusing on nutrient recovery from wastewaters.</p>"

    field_research_focus: "<p><strong>Analog beamforming for blockage-resistant mmW communications</strong><br />Millimeter wave (mmW) systems suffer from long device discovery time during initial access (IA) as well as vulnerability to blockage. Developing improved IA protocols is essential. Focus areas include mmW channel modeling; mmW antenna subsystems and low-power circuits; beam-tracking designs; beamwidth adaptation; hybrid analog/digital beamforming; backhauling protocols; user-base station (BS) association and handover in multi-BS mmW systems; and outage-resilient mmW protocols.</p><p><strong>Collaborative mobile edge computing systems for ultra-low-latency applications</strong><br />Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been embraced by many mobile network operators (MNOs) as a way to create new business opportunities and increase revenues. By developing novel architectures and algorithms to enable autonomous and efficient data processing and networking through cooperation of edge nodes, mobile users, and cloud data centers, ultra-low-latency (millisecond order) applications can be supported. Research topics include delay analysis for ultralatency MEC protocols; energy/quality of experience trade-offs; collaboration between edge nodes within a single MEC operator; dynamic network slicing; machine learning algorithms for latency prediction and task assignment; task partitioning and user-edge node association; MEC-integrated vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications; and privacy-preserving MEC collaboration protocols.</p><p><strong>Security and privacy in wireless communications</strong><br />Physical layer security relies on generating friendly jamming signals to obfuscate transmitted information, so as to improve the signal quality for the legitimate receiver and degrade the signal reception for the eavesdropper. This research focus area includes investigation of information-theoretic secret communications; channel-based authentication and fingerprinting; jamming-resistant protocols; rendezvous and network/device discovery under stealth (selective) attacks; hiding of side-channel information; and security in dynamic spectrum access systems.</p><p><strong>Massive multiple-input multiple-output designs</strong> <br />Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is one of the key enabling techniques of next-generation wireless systems. This technique focuses on the improvements in peak throughput per connection, extreme area capacity, systemwide spectral efficiency, and high user density. In mMIMO systems, a base station (BS) is equipped with hundreds of antennas or more, which are used to serve tens of users simultaneously via MIMO precoding techniques, boosting the spectral efficiency by orders of magnitude compared with a conventional MIMO system. Key challenges to reap the benefits are channel state information (CSI) acquisition and update. Our efforts are focused on developing CSI-free rate-and-precoder adaptation methods<em> </em>for next-generation mMIMO systems.</p><p><strong>Spectrum sharing for heterogeneous wireless systems</strong><br />The FCC now allows wireless providers to operate over the unlicensed bands (e.g., 5 GHz UNII, 5.9 GHz for C-V2X and DSRC), which introduces issues related to contention among systems that operate over these bands. This research area studies the impact of inter-technology interference and devises innovative approaches for enabling harmonious coexistence of heterogeneous wireless technologies in unlicensed bands.</p>"
