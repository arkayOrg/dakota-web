    field_overview: <p>The mission of the Wind Hazard and Infrastructure Performance Center (WHIP-C) is to enhance the resiliency of buildings and infrastructures to resist the extreme winds of hurricanes, tornadoes, and other windstorms.</p><p>Windstorms have a severe effect on society by causing large numbers of fatalities and injuries and devastating damage to residential, commercial, and industrial buildings as well as power, communication, transportation, water, and other lifeline systems. Over the last 20 years, windstorms have caused more than $300 billion in insured losses in the United States alone. The total losses are estimated to be twice that number.</p><p>WHIP-C develops methods and tools for preventing wind hazards from becoming disasters. Its objectives are to seek solutions to real-world problems encountered by the industry; transfer knowledge gained from fundamental research to products and intellectual properties that benefit both the industry and researchers; and develop long-term strategies for enhancing the resiliency of buildings and infrastructure to wind hazards.</p><p>WHIP-C members are primarily from the insurance, risk-modeling, and construction industries. The construction industry plays a key role in reducing the vulnerability of the infrastructure, while the risk-modeling industry strives to provide accurate and credible assessments of the risk. The insurance industry benefits from reduced vulnerability and better understanding of the risk, leading to more affordable insurance and more resilient and sustainable communities.</p>
    field_research_focus: <p>The principal research themes of WHIP-C are characterization of wind hazards; assessment of exposure and vulnerability of buildings and infrastructure; and enhancement of community resilience.</p><p><strong>Characterization of wind hazard</strong><br />The research agenda includes better characterization of wind hazard for a community or a location and improved understanding of wind speed and direction in hurricanes, tornadoes, and other extreme windstorms within the boundary layer. Field measurements and statistical analyses of the measurements are pursued to yield results that help industry partners.</p><p><strong>Assessment of building and infrastructure vulnerability</strong><br />WHIP-C conducts research to better understand the wind loading on structures and the load effects. The outcomes of this research are converted to methods and tools for improved assessments of the exposure and vulnerability of buildings and infrastructure to wind hazards.</p><p><strong>Enhancement of community resilience</strong><br />The resilience of a community lies in the robustness of its buildings and infrastructure and its ability to recover quickly from damage caused by windstorms. Innovative new building products and approaches to retrofit building and infrastructure systems can improve resiliency. WHIP-C pursues research that uses analytical methods and experimental testing to develop products for enhancing community resilience.</p>

    field_overview: <p>The Center for Advanced Electronics Through Machine Learning (CAEML) enables fast, accurate design and verification of microelectronic circuits and systems by creating machine-learning algorithms to derive models for <a name="_Hlk29457196" id="_Hlk29457196">electronic design automation</a>.</p><p>Electronic design automation must advance in response to increasingly ambitious goals for low power, high performance, and a short design cycle time, as well as to increasing concerns about security. Existing machine-learning techniques fall short when applied to systems with many ports, which contain reliability hazards and have nonlinear responses and variability. There is an unmet need for models, methods, and tools that enable fast, accurate design and verification while protecting intellectual property. A behavioral approach to systems modeling will meet this need. CAEML develops new domain-specific machine-learning algorithms to produce models using limited training data. Designers’ knowledge is used to speed up learning and impose physical constraints on the models.</p><p>CAEML pioneers the application of emerging machine-learning techniques to microelectronics and microsystems modeling. CAEML collaborates with microelectronics industry partners, whose products include electronic design automation tools, integrated circuits, mobile systems, and hardware for cloud computing. Working closely with these industry partners ensures that CAEML provides models and tools that will facilitate communications between customers and suppliers while protecting the proprietary information of all parties. This will lead to more efficient and reliable production.</p>
    field_research_focus: <p><strong>Back-end integrated circuit design</strong><br />CAEML uses machine learning to set up customized physical design tools to achieve optimal results with minimal human interaction.</p><p><strong>Computationally efficient simulation of circuit aging including stochastic effects</strong><br />CAEML is developing a method for accurate and efficient simulation of circuit aging due to hot carrier injection and bias temperature instability. Computational efficiency is achieved by using a recurrent neural network to represent a library cell or IP block.</p><p><strong>Enabling side-channel attacks on post-quantum protocols through machine learning</strong><br />CAEML enables single-trace power, side-channel attacks on post-quantum key-exchange protocols using machine learning and quantifies the strength of timing obfuscation defenses against those attacks.</p><p><strong>High-dimensional structural inference</strong><br />In many applications, a time series of high-dimensional latent vector variables is observed indirectly from noisy measurements. CAEML’s research investigates deep Markov models, in which an inference network approximates a posterior probability for the time-dynamics of latent variables by running a multilayer perceptron neural network.</p><p><strong>High-speed bus physical design analysis</strong><br />CAEML is creating a dynamic machine-learning ecosystem to characterize electrical performance of each net in a given printed circuit board or package layout file with confidence bounds and to leverage pre-physical design simulation to collect training data. Stochastic collocation is used to account for manufacturing tolerance and nets will be ranked in descending order of signal integrity performance to determine any bottleneck in the system.</p><p><strong>Machine learning to predict successful </strong><strong>field programmable gate arrays</strong> (<strong>FPGA) compilation strategies</strong><br />CAEML is producing FPGA compilation recipes that show a high success rate and fast compilation time.</p><p><strong>Modular machine learning for behavioral modeling of microelectronic circuits and systems</strong><br />CAEML combines the inherent modularity of modern machine-learning algorithms with the behavioral approach to system design and simulation, to develop mathematical tools for assessing the performance and minimal data requirements for learning a low-complexity representation of the system behavior, one component or subsystem at a time.</p><p><strong>Power/performance/area (PPA) prediction</strong><br />CAEML builds machine learning models and develops associated tools to predict PPA given a register-transfer level description of a circuit, eliminating the need to undertake the lengthy physical design process. To maximize the accuracy of PPA predictions while minimizing the data collection effort, CAEML also is developing a comprehensive data mining methodology.</p><p><strong>Trusted platform design</strong><br />CAEML uses machine-learning techniques to assess whether an “internet of things” system is under cyberattack via power or radio frequency side channels and develop hardware countermeasures to identify and nullify such attacks.</p>

    field_year: 2014
    field_overview: <p>The Center for Advanced Design and Manufacturing of Integrated Microfluidics (CADMIM) develops advanced design tools and manufacturing technologies for integrated microfluidics. Its mission is to advance research and education on the science, engineering, and applications of integrated microfluidic design and scalable production to develop low-power, automated, self-contained, mass-produced microdevices capable of multistep biochemical assessments.</p><p>CADMIM’s goal is to support cost-effective, quick, and easy diagnosis of conditions in<br />the environment, agriculture, and food and water supplies, ultimately to protect human health and safety. For example, developing new medicines requires the efficient screening of millions of compounds, feeding a growing population demands faster breeding and testing of crop varieties, and protecting water supplies or beaches requires rapid lab results for ocean and urban runoff assays. In each of these areas, fluidic samples must be analyzed quickly, accurately, and at the lowest possible cost per test. CADMIM’s strategy centers on mass-produced diagnostic devices equipped with microfluidic components chip-sized devices with high sensitivities and short reaction times of one minute or less that are capable of chemical analyses in miniaturized volumes. </p><p>CADMIM focuses on three research areas that are intellectually intertwined. The ultimate challenge is to simultaneously innovate in all these areas to refine on-chip functions; ensure compatibility and connectivity; integrate intelligence and communication; anticipate, overcome, or circumvent bottlenecks; and create high-capability, self-contained, manufacturable microdevices. This is a fresh approach to microfluidic biochip development, designed to dramatically reduce cost with equal or superior performance to lab-based functionality, allowing for low-cost manufacture and widespread deployment. </p>
    field_research_focus: <p><strong>Integration and control systems</strong><br />Integration combines basic science with the implementation of sensing, analysis, and detection in manufacturable biochips and includes the development of interfaces to manage and communicate results. Options include a visual readout, such as a color change on the chip that can be read by the naked eye or digitally photographed and uploaded to the internet, or an electrical signal that can be interfaced to a smartphone or transmitted via a USB interface to a laptop computer. CADMIM researchers are also investigating the production of biochips with on-command, intelligent, programmable diagnostics that can perform multiple tests at the same time.</p><p><strong>Manufacturable processes and materials</strong><br />Many materials used for microfluidic devices are not suitable for large-scale production, and several manufacturable processes have yet to be explored for the production of low-cost microfluidic chips. Automated roll-to-roll methods for tape-based plastic hot embossing, paper printing, and thin-film metal lamination (e.g., flexible circuit technology), commonly used in consumer products, can all be adapted for lab-on-a-chip production. These processes can be merged to create a new class of mass-produced diagnostic devices.</p><p><strong>Sample processing and detection</strong><br />No group has attempted to jointly address long-standing issues in the microfluidics field in the context of mass-produced, low-cost, disposable, easy-to-use diagnostics. Innovation in sample filtering, constituent enrichment and separation, on-chip reagent storage, and fluidic functions (such as metering, mixing, and transport) in low-cost manufacturable biochips are some of the critical aspects for self-contained labs-on-a-chip. Innovation must also occur at the assay and detection level, such as the development of simplified cellular and molecular assays, tests that implement different transduction mechanisms (e.g., optical, mechanical, magnetic), and probes that are specifically designed to enable cheap disposable microfluidic platforms with more complex functions.</p>

    field_overview: <p>The Center for Cloud and Autonomic Computing (CAC) pursues research and development in cloud and autonomic computing methods and the application of those methods to systems of interest to industry and government partners. CAC’s mission is to advance the knowledge of how to design cloud and autonomic computing systems — that is, computers that are capable of self-healing, self-protecting, and self-optimizing themselves with little involvement of users or system administrators. </p><p>At the intersection of cloud computing and autonomic computing, CAC aims to achieve self-management capabilities within and across the layers of cloud computing systems and applications to enable independent operation, minimize cost and risk, accommodate complexity and uncertainty, and enable systems of systems with large numbers of components.</p><p>CAC activities on cloud computing cut across several layers of information technology (IT) systems, including hardware platforms for computing, storage, and networking; design of data centers that aggregate platforms to provide cloud services; systems software and distributed computing middleware providing programming interfaces and management primitives within and across multiple cloud data centers; applications that leverage the on-demand and scalable nature of cloud platforms; and cybersecurity.</p>
    field_research_focus: <p><strong>Autonomic computing engines and applications</strong><br />Consolidated and virtualized data centers and clouds have become the dominant computing platforms in industry and research for enabling complex and compute-intensive applications. As scales, operating costs, and energy requirements increase, however, maximizing efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and utilization of these systems becomes paramount. Furthermore, the complexity of application workloads makes on-demand scalability critical. CAC is developing autonomic computing and applications frameworks that can support a wide range of applications.</p><p><strong>Distributed systems</strong><br />CAC is developing networks that respond to dynamic network configurations while ensuring high performance, fault tolerance, and security, and integrating these networks with virtualization techniques to provide seamless peer connectivity to a wealth of applications.</p><p><strong>Network defense</strong><br />Autonomic defense systems detect and protect against all types of network attacks. CAC has developed expertise through advanced modeling and deployment of real-world capable systems using autonomic methods for network threat assessment, mitigation, and defense.</p><p><strong>Power management</strong><br />CAC research in this area targets the development of a theoretical framework and a general methodology for autonomic power and performance management of high-performance distributed systems.</p><p><strong>Software management</strong><br />The explosive growth in scale and functionality of enterprise software systems and underlying IT infrastructures has resulted in complex systems whose control and timely management is rapidly exceeding human ability. CAC research in this area is dedicated to developing and integrating autonomic techniques for monitoring, modeling, configuring, controlling, and optimizing the behaviors of applications, services, and resources, to ensure their robust and resilient operation in the face of these challenges.</p><p><strong>Virtualized data centers</strong><br />CAC is working to develop self-monitoring and self-optimization techniques that, when applied to the management of virtualized containers, can lead to increased efficiencies in resource utilization and reduced costs of provisioning.</p>
