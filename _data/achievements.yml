      As the demand for mobile electronics and electric vehicles (EVs) increases, so does the demand for lithium-ion batteries. Recovering the value of these batteries once the devices they power reach their end of life is a challenge. In North America, most used batteries pile up in landfills and only 5% are recycled.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The lack of Li-ion battery recycling capacity is due in part to the unfavorable economics of existing recycling processes. These processes are designed to recover metals from the cathodes of spent Li-ion batteries. However, the cathode’s metal value makes up less than 35% of the total value of the materials within a battery. On the other hand, the cathode’s entire material value represents over 70% of the battery’s material value, and much commercial research and development has therefore focused on recovering more of the cathode materials from spent batteries.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      A major challenge in recycling cathodes is that the incoming supply of spent batteries often consists of a variety of cathode materials, and recovering materials from a mixed stream is difficult. Common cathode materials include lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2), which is the most common cathode material; lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (LiNixMnyCozO2, or NMC), which accounts for one-third of the market; lithium manganese oxide (LiMn2O4, or LMO); lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4); and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (LiNixCoyAlzO2, or NCA).
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Battery Resourcers, LLC, a spin-off of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) based in North Grafton, MA, has developed a recycling process with an exclusive license from WPI that recovers cathode materials from a mixture of spent Li-ion batteries. It involves both physical separation and hydrometallurgical processing.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “Effective and efficient recycling programs for automotive Li-ion batteries has been a challenge for the industry due to the diversity of chemistries and large volume of battery systems,” says Leslie Pinnell, executive director of government R&D programs and intellectual property at A123 Systems, which manufactures Li-ion batteries for electric vehicles. “The WPI process does not require time-consuming sorting and disassembly and results in cathode recovery rather than simply the cathode metals, significantly improving the value proposition for recycling.”
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The process begins with discharging and shredding the batteries into small pieces. Sieves separate the metals (steel, copper, aluminum, graphite) and plastics from the powders, which include the cathode materials. The powders then enter a proprietary hydrometallurgical process that recovers lithium (Li), nickel (Ni), manganese (Mn), and cobalt (Co) by chemical leaching. The pH of the leached solution is adjusted to remove impurities and precipitate out new cathode materials.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      A unique feature of Battery Resourcers’ hydrometallurgical process is that the ratio of Ni, Mn, and Co can be adjusted, which allows a diverse stream of Li-ion batteries to be recycled and a consistent NMC end product to be recovered, such as LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 (NMC 532) or LiNi0.33Mn0.33Co0.33O2 (NMC 111), which make up one-third of the market.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Battery Resourcers’ capability to recover cathode materials and control the morphology of the end product from a Li-ion battery source with mixed cathode chemistry has drawn interest from the automobile industry, because many electric vehicles are now using mixed cathode materials. For example, the new Ford Focus relies on both NMC- and LMO-based batteries.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      WPI is using Battery Resourcers’ recycling process in a project supported by $1 million from the U.S. Advanced Battery Consortium — a collaborative organization of FCA US LLC, Ford Motor Co., and General Motors — to recycle spent EV batteries and recover NMC cathode powder. The recovered powder will be made into cathodes for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle cells and tested at Argonne National Laboratory.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      With support from the National Science Foundation and other ventures, Battery Resourcers is scaling up its process to 50-kg batches and planning to construct a pilot plant this year. The company reports that the NMC 532 and NMC 111 it has recovered on a lab scale has the same impurity concentrations, density, and electrochemical properties as commercial materials. Potential customers who have evaluated samples of the recovered cathodes have given positive feedback.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Pinnell from A123 Systems, which tested some of Battery Resourcers’ recovered cathode powders, says, “A123 is very excited about the quality of Battery Resourcers’ recovered materials.”
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Battery Resourcers has developed the recycling process so that the recovered NMC material will be cost-competitive with current virgin NMC cathode materials (90% of the current price), while improving the industry’s environmental sustainability. By selling the cathode material at this price, the company believes it will be able to flip the economics in favor of recycling for a fully functional plant.

    </p>
  
    <p>
      Bioadvantaged polymers are derived from monomers nonexistent or prohibitively costly in the petrochemical world, such as alginates, cellulose, chitin, unmodified or minimally modified vegetable oils, fatty acids/diacids, polysaccharides, proteins, and starch, among others. They may have physical and chemical property combinations unmatched by any material known today. These polymers present both the greatest challenges and the greatest opportunities for success.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Researchers at Iowa State Univ. (ISU) and the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/center-for-bioplastics-and-biocomposites">Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites (CB2)</a>, an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), are investigating bioadvantaged polymers.

      Using controlled free radical polymerization chemistries, the researchers have developed a family of thermoplastic homopolymers, statistical copolymers, and thermoplastic elastomeric (TPE) block copolymers (BCPs) that employ acrylated vegetable oils and glycerol. Due to their high level of functionality and ability to copolymerize, these materials are highly tunable and can be formulated to serve a wide variety of applications.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      TPE BCPs have a soft block that bridges two rigid blocks, for example, poly(styrene-b-butadiene-b-styrene) (SBS) or poly(styrene-b-isoprene-b-styrene) (SIS). The soft segments exhibit low glass transition temperatures, often below 0°C. The research team produced bio-based soft segments with glass transition temperatures of roughly –45°C by replacing butadiene or isoprene with modified vegetable oils or glycerol. These biopolymers can be used in adhesives, films, packaging materials, sealants, additives, rubbers, and many other related applications. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The ISU team is working with CB2, the Iowa Soybean Association, United Soybean Board, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, and ten companies to evaluate the soybean and glycerin-based bio-polymers as curable waterborne glues and pressure-sensitive adhesives.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In preliminary tests, the bio-polymers’ adhesion properties were comparable to those of petroleum-based adhesives. For example, the team has created a curable waterborne glycerin-based adhesive that provides a high-performance formaldehyde-free alternative to phenolic resins widely used in wood composite materials like plywood and oriented strand board. Scale-up efforts are currently underway, with a goal of generating hundreds of pounds of adhesive in the next few months. The team is also working to produce full-scale wood panels for evaluation by major wood composite manufactures.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Another application includes asphalt modification. Currently, SBS is added to asphalt to improve high-temperature performance. Using a bio-polymer instead of SBS improves not only high-temperature performance, but also aggregate adhesion and cracking resistance in cold climates. These benefits are crucial in lower-quality asphalts, including recycled asphalts, which are susceptible to cracking in cold temperatures. Additionally, biopolymers can be dissolved in commonly used liquid additives to form a pumpable solution, greatly simplifying the polymer modification process.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The ISU team has constructed a 1-ton/day biopolymer processing facility on campus to manufacture material for demonstration projects nationwide. Commissioned in summer 2015, the facility achieved its first successful production run in spring 2017.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The team recently received 50,000 lb of high oleic soybean oil from an industry partner that will be upgraded to the world’s first polymer asphalt modifier that can be blended at the construction site rather than the terminal. The polymer modifier will be used in a few paving projects in the Midwest throughout the late summer and early fall 2018. The researchers and their corporate partners are also planning a test pavement section at the internationally renowned National Center for Asphalt Technology Pavetrack facility in Opelika, AL, which could further accelerate acceptance and adoption.

      Making a payment can be as easy as hovering a smartphone or a smart credit card over a contactless console. A similar touchless technology is on the horizon for fingerprint identification. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In high-traffic areas, like airport security lines, customs, and border crossings, contactless fingerprint ID could reduce wait times and limit the spread of germs. It could give law enforcement officers the flexibility of capturing fingerprints in the field with a mobile phone camera rather than relying on more cumbersome, expensive fingerprinting equipment.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      But making this technology a reality requires overcoming a significant hurdle. Existing fingerprints stored in global databases have been made by touch, which slightly deforms the tiny lines in the print. As a result, touchless prints don’t exactly match those collected by touch, creating a big identification gap. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Jeremy Dawson, associate professor of computer science and electrical engineering at West Virginia University and his teammates, led by Nasser Nasrabadi, a professor of computer science and electrical engineering at West Virginia University, are working on technology to make contactless fingerprint ID more reliable. By collaborating with dozens of affiliates from the security sector who belong to the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/center-for-identification-technology-research">Center for Identification Technology Research  (CITeR)</a> — an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) funded by the National Science Foundation to improve identity science and biometric recognition — the researchers have developed an algorithm that bridges the gap between touch and touchless fingerprint technology. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The advance will help a range of government organizations and private companies, from the U.S. Department of Defense to smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung, and will help transition to a faster, more flexible, and hygienic fingerprint security method.

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <h3>Training the Algorithm</h3>
  
    <p>
      To create a system that’s able to match the two different kinds of prints, the researchers developed a deep-learning algorithm that learns from what it’s shown and then uses that knowledge on new information. They first fed the algorithm tens of thousands of known legacy fingerprint images taken with a touch-based sensor as well as tens of thousands of images of fingerprints taken with contactless technology. Next, they asked the algorithm to look for subtle differences between the two types of fingerprints. The researcher repeated this learning phase tens of thousands of times. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      After training the algorithm, the researchers began feeding it sets of fingerprints it hadn’t seen before and asking it to find matches. In Dawson’s most recent experiments, the algorithm was 99% accurate at finding a match on this relatively small dataset. Dawson and his team want to push accuracy to 99.999%, but that’s not easy and it will depend on gathering a dataset of tens of millions of individuals.
    </p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <p>
      “We’re training a machine to see the differences in these prints. It then knows that these two different samples collected in different ways belong to the same person,” Dawson noted. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Acquiring a large number of fingerprints for training and testing the algorithms was one of the biggest challenges, says Dawson. Because of privacy issues, fingerprint databases from law enforcement offices, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are not available for research. Since 2008, Dawson has been building a database of tens of thousands of touch-based and touchless fingerprints from students, staff, and residents of the surrounding community who have signed consent forms to participate in human subjects’ research. No record is tied to a name to maintain the person’s privacy, and the fingerprints are never entered into any civil or criminal database.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The team submitted a patent application for the technology in Spring 2020 and is actively searching for an industry partner to develop a software package that can be licensed.

      Engineers often want to combine many types of materials into a composite architecture to achieve specific performances in devices, from electronics to biomedical implants. However, material compatibility issues that arise during manufacturing can limit practical realization of these composites.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Sintering — a common technique to engineer composites — transforms constituent material powders, with heat, into a dense layer or solid body. Sintering traditionally occurs at extremely high temperatures near, but below, the material’s melting point (e.g., most ceramics require temperatures exceeding 1,000°C). However, such high temperatures produce undesired outcomes, such as the melting of metals, decomposition of polymeric materials, and interfacial reactions.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Material incompatibilities make combining metals, plastics, and ceramics unfeasible in many applications. Thus, engineers are motivated to search for better ways to sinter diverse materials at lower temperatures.
    </p>

        Cold sintering creates composite materials with lower energy costs, such as Li2MoO4 capacitor structures on nickel foil, which is sintered at 100 MPa for 15 min at 120°C.

    <p>
      Researchers at the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/center-for-dielectrics-and-piezoelectrics">Center for Dielectrics and Piezoelectrics (CDP)</a> — a National Science Foundation Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (NSF IUCRC) involving North Carolina State Univ. and Pennsylvania State Univ. — have discovered a technique to sinter materials at low temperatures to form new materials with densities that approach the theoretical limit of zero porosity. This technology, called the cold sintering process (CSP), offers new opportunities for integrating previously incompatible materials and drastically lowers the energy and time required in the sintering process.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Clive Randall of Penn State, the lead researcher on CSP, says, “Not only is CSP a low-temperature process (room temperature up to 300°C), but we are also densifying some materials to over 95% of their theoretical density in 15 minutes. We can now make a ceramic faster than you can bake a pizza, and at lower temperatures.”
    </p>
  
    <p>
      To perform CSP, operators wet ceramic powder with a few drops of water or an acid solution, which partially dissolves the solid surfaces of the particles at the particle-particle interfaces. The temperature and pressure are increased (to 100–300°C and 100–350 MPa) to trigger an initial non-equilibrium thermodynamic densification process: First, the solid particles rearrange. Then, elemental constituents from the solid particles dissolve and diffuse through the supersaturated liquid phase. Next, particles densify into a solid body and reprecipitate. Locally high pressures near the particle interfaces mimic typical hydrothermal crystal growth conditions, which are important in geological mineral formation.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “I see the cold sintering process as a continuum of different significant challenges,” Randall says. “In some systems, it’s so easy, you don’t need pressure. In others, you do. In some, you need to use nanoparticles. In others, you can get away with a mixture of nanoparticles and larger particles. It really all depends on the systems and chemistries you are talking about, the inherent transport mechanisms in play, and the structure-property relationships.” Researchers at the CDP seek to explore the fundamental mechanisms and model the processes that drive cold sintering.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The team is building a library of the precise techniques required to use CSP on various material systems, such as ceramic-ceramic composites, ceramic-nanoparticle composites, ceramic-metals, and ceramic-polymers. They have verified 50 processes to date. They are also extending the scope of research to a broad range of inorganic and organic-inorganic dielectrics that are of interest to the dielectrics and piezoelectrics industry.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Richard Clark, senior technical specialist for Morgan Advanced Materials (a large manufacturing corporation specializing in advanced materials science and engineering of ceramics, carbon, and composites), believes that cold sintering is a step change for ceramics materials processing. Lower temperatures reduce energy costs of production as well as allow for new combinations of materials and functionalities. Applications for cold sintering include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          reinforced ceramic composites for toughened refractories
        </li>
        <li>
          solid-state ionically conducting ceramic electrolytes for next-generation lithium ion batteries
        </li>
        <li>
          ceramics with embedded sensors for use as medical implants.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “The savings in energy costs could be worth billions to industry, if the process could be ramped up to factory-floor scale,” says Clark.

    Catalyzing Commercialization: Creating Novel Bimetallic Catalysts for Methanol Fuel Cells

    Improvements in direct-methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have been achieved at the Univ. of South Carolina based on a new, easy-to-scale method to synthesize bimetallic catalysts.
    The two most common types of fuel cells being developed for mobile transportation applications are DMFCs and hydrogen fuel cells. Methanol is safer than hydrogen, and

      Improvements in direct-methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) have been achieved at the Univ. of South Carolina based on a new, easy-to-scale method to synthesize bimetallic catalysts.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The two most common types of fuel cells being developed for mobile transportation applications are DMFCs and hydrogen fuel cells. Methanol is safer than hydrogen, and it is easier to handle and install in refueling stations. Whereas a monometallic platinum (Pt) catalyst may be used for H2 fuel cells, a more-expensive bimetallic catalyst — typically consisting of Pt and ruthenium (Ru) — is required for DMFCs.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In a DMFC, methanol oxidation takes place at the anode. During methanol oxidation, the intermediate carbon monoxide (CO) is formed, which strongly adsorbs on the Pt surface, reducing the number of available reaction sites and thus the performance of the cell. Ru helps to counteract this effect by acting as an adsorption site for H2O. The H2O reacts with adsorbed CO to form CO2 and H2, the desired product. In theory, metals such as cobalt (Co) and nickel (Ni) could serve as less-expensive alternatives to Ru.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In order for bimetallic catalysts to be effective, the two metals must be in close contact. However, the most common way to make these catalysts, a process termed co-impregnation, is unable to do this effectively. During co-impregnation, metal nanoparticles are deposited on the surface of a substrate. The quantity, size, and distribution of the deposited nanoparticles are difficult to control. And, achieving co-impregnation without segregation of the two metals is nearly impossible.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      With funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF), chemical engineers at the Univ. of South Carolina have developed a simple, effective, generalizable method for the synthesis of supported bimetallic nanoparticles in which the two metals are intimately alloyed and the size of the nanoparticles can be precisely controlled. This method is called co-electroless deposition (co-ED).
    </p>
  
    <a name="fig1">
      <figure>
        <img alt="co-electroless deposition graph" src="site.baseurl/visuals/achievements/co_ed.png">

          <strong>Figure 1.</strong> (a) In co-electroless deposition (co-ED), metal seed particles are attached to a carbon substrate. A bimetallic shell forms over each seed particle. (b) Researchers used co-ED to create a variety of catalysts and evaluated their mass activities with cyclic voltammetry.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </a>
  
    <p>
      The new process (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1a</a>) employs precision flow delivery of metal precursor solutions into a reactor with a solution of a reducing agent such as dimethylamine borane (DMAB). The metals in the precursor solutions are quickly and completely reduced on the surface of pre-deposited metal seed particles that are attached to a carbon support layer. The metals form an evenly distributed bimetallic shell around the seed particles. The thickness and composition of the shell is determined by the amounts and rates of metals being deposited.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Previous computational studies predicted optimal atomic ratios of Pt-Co and Pt-Ni catalysts, but these ratios had largely been untested due to the difficulties of preparing bimetallic catalysts with uniform compositions. The UofSC team created and validated several of these catalyst compositions.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The engineers chose palladium nanoparticles as their seed particles, although any catalytic metal (e.g., Ni, Cu, or Ag) can be used. They created several Pt-Ni and Pt-Co bimetallic catalysts with varying atomic ratios and weight percentages of Pt (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1b</a>). Each catalyst was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV).
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Testing showed that a few of their catalysts had substantially higher mass activities (i.e., useful power) than a conventional Pt catalyst and a commercially available Pt-Ru catalyst. In fact, a Pt-Co catalyst with an atomic ratio of 2.4:1 was more than twice as active than the commercial benchmark catalyst and it used only 0.24 wt% Co, at 1/7,000th of the cost of Ru.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The co-ED technique can be extended to chemical catalyst applications and applied to substrates other than carbon, such as silica, titania, and alumina. By precisely controlling the thickness of the bimetallic shell, co-ED enables less metal to be used in production of bimetallic catalysts, which will help lower their cost. Reducing the costs of bimetallic catalysts will be critical in making DMFCs viable for automobiles. Most importantly, co-ED is straightforward, versatile, and can be easily scaled for larger applications.

      The biopharmaceutical industry has emerged as a major manufacturing engine of the U.S. economy. With new biological information brought about through technology innovation and data acquisition, ample opportunities exist to improve biomanufacturing efficiencies.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The <a href="site.baseurl/centers/advanced-mammalian-biomanufacturing-innovation-center">Advanced Mammalian Biomanufacturing Innovation Center (AMBIC)</a>, supported by the National Science Foundation’s Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers Program (IUCRC), seeks to transform upstream cell culture bioprocessing in three areas: industrially relevant biology; process monitoring and control; and consensus and standardization.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Supported by 17 industrial members representing a cross-section of the biopharma industry, AMBIC is based at Johns Hopkins Univ. (JHU), Clemson Univ., Univ. of Delaware (UD), and Univ. of Massachusetts (UMass) Lowell, and has an affiliate site at the Univ. of Maryland, College Park (UMD).
    </p>
  
    <p>
      AMBIC seeks to make biopharmaceutical manufacturing processes more efficient and cost-effective by bringing together leaders from industry, academia, and government to foster upstream mammalian cell culture innovation.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      One major objective of this partnership is to develop a reference cell culture platform for biomanufacturing. While Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the principal platform used to produce the great majority of biopharmaceuticals worldwide, no common CHO cell line, culture media/feed, or process exists as a standard or baseline for innovation and comparison across the field. The availability of such a platform will facilitate a better understanding of cells and cell culture processes in a manner that is impossible today, given the diversity of cell lines and media currently used.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Other AMBIC projects are building on this reference platform effort, such as an investigation by Winston Timp (JHU) to elaborate the epigenetic state of cells and identify favorable expression conditions. Similarly, Kelvin Lee and Bramie Lenhoff (UD) are characterizing host-derived proteins in industrially relevant conditions.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Maciek Antonowiecz (UD), Seongkyu Yoon (UMass), and Mike Betenbaugh (JHU) are evaluating how cells in culture utilize nutrients and identifying potentially inhibitory waste metabolites that can accumulate in culture. This information is also used to enhance a genome-scale metabolic model of CHO cell culture performance. Additionally, Sarah Harcum’s lab at Clemson Univ. is developing control strategies to maintain the cell cultures in a highly productive state.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Projects are also under way to investigate culture conditions. For example, surface-enhanced raman spectroscropy (SERS) technologies developed by Jake Khurgin (JHU) and wireless multicomponent sensing developed by William Bentley and colleagues at UMD can provide more efficient process monitoring within bioreactors. All of these efforts are being applied to optimize CHO cell growth, bioproduct yields, and product quality.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Although AMBIC is only a year and a half old, it has already established a framework for cooperation and collaboration between teams of academic, industry, and government scientists. Industry mentors meet virtually with university researchers on a monthly basis, enabling more direct interactions between graduate students and industrial engineers and scientists. These experiences help focus students’ training and address workforce development needs in a way that has not been attempted at this scale in the U.S.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Ultimately, AMBIC’s activities will have a lasting impact on the cell culture community through innovation and workforce development in a critically important sector of the economy that provides life-saving medicines to patients around the world.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Key outcomes of AMBIC</h3>

    Catalyzing Commercialization: Researchers Develop Rapid, Low-Cost Norovirus Detection Platform

    A little bit of norovirus — the highly infectious microbe that causes about 20 million cases of food poisoning in the U.S. each year — goes a long way.

      A little bit of norovirus — the highly infectious microbe that causes about 20 million cases of food poisoning in the U.S. each year — goes a long way. Just 10 particles of the virus can cause illness in humans. While norovirus is often associated with cruise ships, it can also spread quickly through a community via its water supply. Norovirus causes about 200,000 deaths globally each year.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Advances in rapid monitoring of human viruses in water are essential for protecting public health. Devices to detect norovirus in small quantities do already exist, but they typically involve a laboratory setting and require an array of microscopes, lasers, and spectrometers that can cost thousands of dollars and necessitate lengthy protocols.

    <p>
      With funding from the National Science Foundation’s Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) for <a href="site.baseurl/centers/water-and-environmental-technology">Water and Environmental Technology (WET)</a>, a team of Univ. of Arizona researchers, led by Jeong-Yeol Yoon and Kelly A. Reynolds, has created a simple, portable, and inexpensive method for detecting extremely low levels of norovirus. This rapid, low-cost water-quality monitoring technology could be a transformational tool for reducing both local and global disease burdens.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      To detect norovirus in the field, such as on cruise ships or in municipal water wells, the team decided to use simple materials: paper, in the form of microfluidic chips, and a smartphone. The nitrocellulose paper substrate is very inexpensive and easy to store, and it can be easily fabricated into a microfluidic chip. The fibrous structure of paper allows liquid to flow spontaneously without using the pumping systems usually required by other chips, such as silicon chips.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Scientists typically detect contaminants on microfluidic chips by measuring the scattering and reflection of light in a sample. However, paper’s porousness and opacity can cause background scattering that interferes with imaging — making it difficult to detect very small concentrations of a virus. Rather than measuring light intensity, the team developed a new way to detect norovirus by counting fluorescent beads.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The process starts with adding potentially contaminated water to one end of a paper microfluidic chip. The researchers used a pipette to deliver a known volume of sample onto the chip, but any type of dropper will also work. To the other end, a tester adds tiny, fluorescent polystyrene beads. Each bead is attached to an antibody against norovirus. If norovirus is present, several of the antibodies attach to each virus particle, creating a little clump of fluorescent beads.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Norovirus particles and their antibodies are too small to be imaged by a smartphone microscope. However, when you have two or more of these beads joined together, the clump of beads is large enough for a smartphone microscope to detect and photograph. A smartphone app the researchers created counts the number of illuminated pixels in the image to identify the number of aggregated beads and, subsequently, the number of norovirus particles in the sample.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “This user-friendly smartphone technology revolutionizes water-quality testing in the field. It delivers rapid, accurate results for norovirus and other microbial and chemical contaminants,” says Dan Quintanar, project manager, Tucson Water.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Each test costs less than $10. The most expensive component of the whole device — the smartphone microscope — is available commercially and costs less than $50. The end-user does not have to be a scientist or an engineer to run the microscope. The entire testing process is easy to complete because analysis is performed automatically by the smartphone app. Used paper strips can be safely disposed in any trash receptacle.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “The smartphone technology is a wonderful example of the National Science Foundation IUCRC Program enabling collaboration between the private sector and academia,” states Ian Pepper, Site Director, Univ. of Arizona, NSF WET Center.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In the future, the Univ. of Arizona team hopes to develop methods for detecting norovirus infections in patients even earlier and to expand their smartphone monitoring platform to detect other environmental hazards, such as potentially cancer-causing chemicals. They also plan to commercialize the device for periodic and continuous monitoring.

    Catalyzing Commercialization: Tiny Optical Fiber Sensors Offer Continuous, In situ Measurement of Humidity
  description: >-
    Humidity is a very important parameter to monitor and control when drying food products, pulp and paper products, chemicals, and other semi-moist, porous materials. It can impact drying optimization and, ultimately, product shelf life. However, humidity sensors can be unrealiable, especially when used in large industrial ovens that dry, bake, or de-water materials. Accuracy and precision, along with durability and size, are all important factors for successful automated humidity sensing.

      Humidity is a very important parameter to monitor and control when drying food products, pulp and paper products, chemicals, and other semi-moist, porous materials.

Accuracy and precision, along with durability and size, are all important factors for successful automated humidity sensing.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In bakery products, for example, a 1% change in finished product moisture can dramatically impact staling and shelf life, and importantly, consumer preference for the product. Cookies, crackers, breakfast cereal, and even pet food have stringent targets for final product moisture. Humidity monitoring is often performed offline (post-oven) because inline humidity sensing — inside an oven using standard electrical sensors based on capacitive sensing elements — is difficult.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Researchers at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) have developed technology for probe-like fiber optic humidity sensors that solve many of the problems associated with existing electrical sensors. This pre-competitive research is conducted on behalf of the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/center-for-advanced-research-in-drying">Center for Advanced Research in Drying (CARD)</a>, an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center funded by the National Science Foundation.

    </figure>
  
    <p>
      The technology is based on measuring fiber-guided light signals in response to a moisture change. A fiber’s tip is polished to create a flat surface on one side, which is coated with sub-micron-thick tin dioxide. The flat fiber end face serves as a mirror and reflects the light back along the same fiber. Moisture around the sensor influences the refractive index of the tin oxide, which alters the reflected optical spectrum. The changing optical spectrum can be monitored in real time by a spectrometer. Researchers have demonstrated a linear relationship between moisture level and optical signal change.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Fiber optic cables can withstand high temperatures (above 400°F) without breaking down, and they have a very tiny (~250 μm diameter) footprint. Optical fibers are also immune to electromagnetic interference inherent in tunnel ovens. Other potential improvements over capacitive sensing chips may include higher accuracy, better resolution, and detection of very low moisture levels (below 5%). Development of these sensors can help companies improve product quality and throughput in a manufacturing environment.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      For pilot-scale testing, the tip of the optic fiber can be inserted directly into the product itself and in situ measurements can be made. This is a great research benefit to understand the humidity profile of the actual product as it progresses through an oven.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      For commercial applications, fiber optic humidity sensors can be wall-mounted and used for measuring the humidity inside the chamber. The measurement can be correlated with moisture in the product and used for effective monitoring and control strategies. And, continuous moisture measurement can help in building autonomous manufacturing systems.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “The unique characteristics of these fiber optic sensors can provide key advantages over existing sensors. We hope to exploit those capabilities to optimize how we monitor and control our processes,” says Michael Bordonaro, Senior Principal Engineer, Global Research and Development, Ingredion, Inc.

      Just like us, cells need to watch what they eat. For the first time, researchers studying cells used to create medicines like monoclonal antibodies—which can help treat cancer and autoimmune diseases—have found what goes into cells affects what comes out. Their results identified compounds that helped produce beneficial products and some that were too much of a good thing. Ultimately, this can help pharmaceutical companies manufacture drugs more efficiently.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “We found by limiting the choices that you give the cells—by changing the menu—you help the cells make healthier choices, and eventually produce the product that you're interested in,” said Maciek R. Antoniewicz, at the University of Michigan, and co-lead researcher on the project together with Michael J. Betenbaugh at the Johns Hopkins University. Their work was conducted with the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/advanced-mammalian-biomanufacturing-innovation-center">Advanced Mammalian Biomanufacturing Innovation Center (AMBIC)</a>, an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) funded by the National Science Foundation.

      Increasingly, certain types of cells from mammals are being used to produce medicine. This method, which is a part of the new line of medicine known as biotherapeutics, can create complex proteins and other products that are impossible to make with traditionally synthesized chemical compounds. However, it is an expensive and time-consuming process.

    <h3>Following the Breadcrumbs</h3>
  
    <p>
      In biotherapeutics, cells are grown in a material called media. Before now, scientists didn’t know the specifics of how cells consume, or metabolize, the media. To study this, scientists tested two types of cells that are commonly used to produce products for medicine.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The researchers first marked different organic compounds, such as amino acids, with stable isotopes of carbon that are heavier than typical carbon atoms. This allowed them to track what the cells did with the compounds. They found some of the amino acids, when present in small amounts, were efficiently made into the medicinally useful products. But, when given too abundantly, they also created toxins as a by-product.
    </p>
  
    <figure>
      <img alt="CO2 growth chamber" src="site.baseurl/visuals/achievements/mpc_c02_growth_chamber.jpg">

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <p>
      “We were surprised that some of these amino acids were metabolized inefficiently,” Antoniewicz said. “We came to the conclusion that there was quite a bit of room for improvement still in the composition of the media.”
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Feeding the cells with the right compounds in the right amounts could help improve the cells’ production efficiency. Additionally, many cell lines have lifetimes of only a couple weeks. By removing the compounds that produce toxins as a by-product, the cells may be able to live an extra week longer, which could further improve their productivity. Combined, this will help drive down the costs of these biotherapeutics and help meet the global demand for these types of medicine.

    <h3>Collaboration Yields Economic Impacts</h3>
  
    <p>
      The nutrient media used to grow cells are often pharmaceutical companies’ highly guarded secrets. The new project was possible thanks to AMBIC, which facilitated research and industry collaboration.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “The economic impact of medium development like this is enormous, as previous medium development efforts have been demonstrated to impact product quality and significantly increase cell productivity,” said Sandra Bennun Serrano, staff engineer at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, who worked with Antoniewicz on the project. “As many of these projects require a high level of expertise and time commitment, they would not be feasible to pursue by individual companies.”
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Similarly, the scientists agreed on the necessity of collaboration in the field. “We were fortunate enough that one of the sponsors of this project gave us a formulation for an older version of the media that they no longer sell,” Antoniewicz said. “This project simply would not have been possible without the close cooperation with these companies.”
    </p>
  
    <p class="keep-margin">
      In light of the new results, pharmaceutical companies will be able to update their media formulas. In addition to improving the cells’ diet, Antoniewicz and his colleagues are working on improving the cellular machinery itself through genetic engineering.

    Catalyzing Commercialization: Membrane-Based Technologies Treat Produced Water from Oil and Gas Operations

With a global oil production rate of 100 million bbl/day, the volumetric production rate of produced water is massive.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The cost to dispose of produced water, for example, by deep-well injection, is very high — up to $4/bbl. Improper discharge of these streams can damage the environment, destroy local ecosystems, and pollute natural water sources. Treatment of produced water is very challenging, as it often contains large amounts of dissolved salts, scaling compounds, silica, and a variety of organic species. Efficient treatment techniques are critical for developing economically viable oil and gas operations. It is essential to reduce total dissolved solids (TDS) and total/dissolved organic carbon (TOC/DOC) to levels suitable for discharge or external reuse.

    <p>
      The <a href="site.baseurl/centers/membrane-engineering-science-and-technology">Membrane Science, Engineering and Technology (MAST) Center</a> is developing novel membrane-based technologies for treatment of produced water. Direct-contact membrane distillation (DCMD) is one of the most promising strategies. In a DCMD process, the hot produced water supplies the driving temperature difference for water vapor to pass through very fine pores of hydrophobic membranes, which do not allow penetration by the brine solution. Water is recovered as cold distillate on the other side of the membrane.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) is an enhanced oil recovery process. MAST researchers at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) found that DCMD could be used to treat SAGD produced water, which is at high temperatures (130–160°C) and pressures (2–5 atm). Previously, DCMD had not been carried out under such high temperature and pressure conditions. In particular, hydrophobic flat-sheet as well as hollow-fiber membranes of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) were highly effective at recovering water and rejecting TDS. The water recovered after membrane treatment could be used directly as a boiler feed to produce the steam needed for injection into the oil shales. The results obtained from this research are under consideration for potential licensing.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In MAST studies at the Univ. of Arkansas (UA), engineers used flat-sheet ethylene chlorotrifluoroethylene (ECTFE) membranes to treat produced water obtained from natural gas extraction facilities in the Marcellus and Fayetteville shale formations. Before treatment, the produced water contained 22,000–235,000 mg/L TDS. Water recoveries up to 70% were achieved during testing. And, in a continuous long-term trial, a brine sample containing 134,000 mg/L TDS was concentrated up to 50% using DCMD for over 434 hr at a constant rate of treated water production. These results indicate that the commercial ECTFE membrane is ideally suited for treating produced waters.

      A team from the Univ. of Colorado Boulder, on behalf of MAST, developed a bicontinuous cubic lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) nanofiltration membrane (dubbed TFC QI) that can treat highly contaminated produced waters. The monomer and polar solvent of the LLC arrange themselves (i.e., self-assemble) into a nanostructured material with discrete hydrophilic regions (i.e., pores); this nanostructure is locked into place via polymerization. The pores, approximately 1 nm in width, extend continuously throughout the material, creating a network through which water and solutes can pass. This nanostructure distinguishes the TFC QI membrane material from its less-structured commercial counterparts. The membrane has pores comparable in size to those of a commercial nanofiltration (NF) membrane, but a salt rejection capability closer to that of a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      When applied to aqueous industrial streams, this novel TFC QI membrane exhibits a unique ability to collect small organic solutes from high-salinity, oily feedwater and produce a lower-saline permeate stream. A feed stream containing 15,000 mg/L TDS and 1,250 mg/L DOC was treated with this membrane; the retentate contained only 5,000 mg/L TDS and 210 mg/L DOC. The treated stream was then fed to a biological degradation unit for final treatment. After biotreatment, a total water recovery of 50% was achieved, with a 67% reduction in TDS and a 95% reduction in DOC.

    Catalyzing Commercialization: Microfluidics-Based Bioanalytical Solutions Change the Game
  description: >-
    Microfluidic devices operate at physical length scales similar to biological constituents (e.g., cells and molecules) and can manipulate solutions of these constituents within microscale channels and chambers. A microfluidic device, also called a lab-on-a-chip (LOC), takes advantage of physics at these small dimensions to detect low sample concentrations — in the nanomolar to picomolar range — with high sensitivity. LOC devices can carry out assays at extremely small volumes, with just a microliter or picoliter of fluid.

      At the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/center-for-advanced-design-and-man-of-integrated-microfluidics">Center for Advanced Design and Manufacturing of Integrated Microfluidics (CADMIM)</a>, supported by the National Science Foundation, researchers are developing microfluidic platforms for rapid assessment of the environment, food and water supplies, and human health. Current methods to obtain such data are inefficient, costly, and labor intensive. By developing microscale tools and technologies in partnership with industry, CADMIM aims to bring simpler, faster, and cheaper bioanalytical capabilities to a wide variety of business sectors.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      CADMIM-funded technology has formed the basis for several startup companies. The center facilitates cross-site collaboration and technology translation. CADMIM is composed of two university sites — Univ. of California, Irvine (UCI) and the Univ. of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). The center’s industrial advisory board has 11 corporate members.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      CADMIM scientists are pursuing innovative, pre-competitive research in key application areas such as sample preparation (e.g., tissue dissociation, nucleic acid purification, and cell and particle separation and sorting). They are targeting a wide range of specimens for testing, including untreated biofluids, plant and animal cell lysate, and tumor biopsies. CADMIM also develops microfluidics systems for diagnostics, automated bioassays, and in vitro and wearable point-of-care systems. The center is particularly focused on innovations that are easy to manufacture, which helps streamline the idea-to-product process.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      CADMIM Director Abraham Lee, Jered Haun, and Wendy Liu from UCI are developing an addressable microwell array to select, identify, and recover single cells for applications in healthcare. Improved methods to isolate single cells, such as from human solid tumor tissue specimens, would dramatically advance our understanding of cancer biology and usher in an era of cell-based molecular diagnostics in clinical settings.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Ian Papautsky (UIC), CADMIM Codirector, is addressing the needs of the agricultural biotechnology industry with the development of an electrochemical sensor to assess plant nutrition. The sensors would be placed directly on the plant to measure levels of critical nutrients such as nitrates, electrolytes, and sodium, giving researchers a better assessment of plant health. This would in turn help farmers optimize agricultural practices and improve crop yields. And, sensor technologies developed as part of this project could be extended beyond plant sciences and used to monitor cells in culture.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      CADMIM faculty members from both sites often collaborate on industrially relevant research. Salman Khetani (UIC) and Elliot Hui (UCI) are developing an organ-on-a-chip — a microfluidic screening platform that will mimic multicellular systems such as the liver. Using this concept to create a liver-on-a-chip will help researchers develop novel therapeutics against diseases such as hepatitis B viral infection. The platform will enable the screening of thousands of compounds in early drug discovery research, and will help mitigate the risk of drug toxicity to patients in the clinic.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      CADMIM LOC devices are applicable in emerging areas such as:
  
      <ul>
        <li>
          personalized medicine and precision agriculture, where analysis is correlated to the person or plant’s specific makeup (e.g., genome, habits, environment, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          forensic science and homeland security, where point-of-need screening for drugs or residues is required
        </li>
        <li>
          digital healthcare, rehabilitation, and wellness monitoring.
        </li>

      More than 40,000 women and 500 men in the United States die from breast cancer each year, according to the American Cancer Society. But a novel computer model could help cut those numbers in half by 2026. The artificial intelligence (AI) tool is built using 1.6 million anonymous healthcare entries from more than 260,000 breast cancer patients over a period of 41 years. Through meaningful analysis of a number of data points, including patient demographics and medical actions taken, the model aims to provide physicians with decision-making information that personalizes treatment. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “We want to help a patient chose the optimal action for her at a particular stage so that she can have the best outcomes and quality of life following her diagnosis,” says the lead researcher on the project, Hui Yang, an associate professor of industrial and manufacturing engineering at The Pennsylvania State University and the site director of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.chot.psu.edu/">Center for Health Organization Transformation</a> — an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) funded by the National Science Foundation to drive innovations in healthcare. Yang launched the project two years ago as part of an IUCRC partnership with Susan G. Komen®, the world’s leading breast cancer organization.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Although the medical field is full of highly skilled healthcare workers and protocols for treating breast cancer patients, the disease remains the second most common cause of death from cancer in women in the United States, according to the <a target="_blank" href="https://mchb.hrsa.gov/whusa11/hstat/hshi/downloads/pdf/214c.pdf">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>. Several variables influence these numbers, among them the need for better decision-making models that give practitioners the information they need to discuss tailored treatments with patients.

    <p>
      Yang and his colleagues began collecting data that would help them answer some specific research questions. They include, How does breast cancer behave over time? If a patient is in a certain state, such as early diagnosis or post-mastectomy, what is the probability that she will move to a different state, such as remission or recurrence? How does an action, such as radiation and chemotherapy, impact a patient’s quality of life or the medical cost of treatment?
    </p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <p>
      The researchers pulled anonymous patient data from public breast cancer databases, such as those run by the National Cancer Institute and Centers for Disease Control to amass 1.6 million entries in all from patients diagnosed and treated between 1975 to 2016. The entries trace every patient from the first diagnosis to each outcome along the way. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      They put these details into a machine-learning algorithm that’s designed to characterize the data and produce a probability that certain actions will lead to certain outcomes. Those results come from patients that have already undergone treatment. The algorithm learns from the actions and outcomes and is trained over time to become more accurate at formulating the probability. Eventually, says Yang, the final model will help Komen with its mission of saving lives, through informing its education programs, public policy advocacy, and support of research to prevent and cure breast cancer. Yang and his team will also turn the algorithm into a software application that physicians can use to help make decisions. For instance, a doctor would input details around the patient’s demographics and diagnoses and then receive the probabilistic estimate of risks along a course of actions for treatment.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “We want to provide healthcare professionals with useful decision-support tools so that they can develop the optimal, personalized treatment strategy for patients,” says Yang.

      By leveraging big datasets and artificial intelligence, researchers are learning how to create more personalized medical treatments that could result in better patient outcomes and significant economic impacts.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The collaboration of physicians and computer scientists based at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who are a part of the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/center-for-computing-and-genomics">Center for Computational Biology and Genomic Medicine (CCBGM)</a>—an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) funded by the National Science Foundation—have found patterns by combining large, existing drug therapy datasets with physician insights. 
    </p>
  
    <h3>Identifying patterns for personalized treatments</h3>
  
    <p>
      The patterns showed how individuals responded to particular treatments, giving insight on which drug treatments could work best based on characteristics like gender, ethnicity, and genetic makeup. This allowed researchers to identify possible pathways to develop more effective, personalized treatments for a form of breast cancer and for depression. The patterns, which were revealed using machine learning algorithms, also allowed the researchers to work backwards to determine why a certain treatment worked well with a particular subset of people. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “We have used artificial intelligence and machine learning not only as a way to pick and select treatments, but to also prioritize biomarkers so that we can go back in and see what the biology of the mechanisms behind these drugs is—how it’s actually working,” said Arjun Athreya, an assistant professor and principal data scientist leading the machine learning strategies of the project at the Mayo Clinic’s department of molecular pharmacology and experimental therapeutics. “Our ability to identify and prioritize which gene needs to be studied in the laboratory has significantly accelerated discovery research, by allowing novel hypotheses to be tested.” 
    </p>
  
    <h3>Discovering new treatments</h3>
  
    <p>
      Looking at drug treatments for triple-negative breast cancer—a particularly aggressive form for which targeted treatments remain to be found—the data showed one gene in particular, CDC42, was affected by the drug Metformin. This drug is typically used for treating diabetes, and the basis for its anti-cancer properties likely would not have been discovered without the aid of the new technique. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The collaborators also looked at individualizing therapy for major depressive disorder (MDD). Today, patients diagnosed with depression can try four to six antidepressants before their symptoms improve—a process that takes months. Combining genomic data with predictive clinical measures, the machine learning methods were able to increase the predictability of anti-depression drug treatment effectiveness to 75%—much higher than the standard 56% accuracy achieved through sociodemographic factors alone. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Considering that MDD affects cognitive and concentration abilities at work, getting patients back to their normal lives sooner through proper medication has tremendous benefits for the patients, their families, and in the workplace. The World Health Organization estimates that by 2030, the global economic impact of MDD in the workplace will be $16 trillion. The new approach to predicting drug response could dramatically decrease that impact and potentially even bolster the global economy.  
    </p>

      Athreya is expanding collaborations with clinicians and industry partners to study other chronic and rare conditions. The Mayo Clinic, where Athreya works, is looking to leverage the power of artificial intelligence in transforming the way physicians provide care for patients. They are additionally working to expand their studies by leveraging population-scale biobanks nationwide to recruit people of African American and Hispanic heritage, who traditionally are under-represented in clinical trials.

    New Technique Provides Faster, Lower-Cost Detection in Surveillance Images
  description: >-
    Processing images from surveillance cameras is a time-consuming and costly endeavor. A new technique developed by researchers at the Center for Net-Centric and Cloud Software and Systems (NCSS) with funding from the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) program, has found a more efficient way to process surveillance images. The new technique has the potential to reduce system and processing costs, enabling faster detections.

      Processing images from surveillance cameras is a time-consuming and costly endeavor. A new technique developed by researchers at the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/net-centric-and-cloud-software-and-system">Center for Net-Centric and Cloud Software and Systems (NCSS)</a> with funding from the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) program, has found a more efficient way to process surveillance images. The new technique has the potential to reduce system and processing costs, enabling faster detections. It also has promising applications for medical imagery and wearable cameras. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Rather than using previous methods that unpacked a whole image, the researchers focused on just the pertinent information. Imagine a surveillance system mounted on a drone for a search and rescue effort. The background landscape information isn’t important—you’re just looking for a human figure. The researchers developed an object detecting and tracking algorithm that looks specifically for the key information.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The process was designed for images that come from a type of camera known as a compressive camera, which is becoming increasingly common in consumer products like drone surveillance, medical imaging, and police body cameras. Compressive cameras, which use a system called compressive sensing, are often used in technology that is resource-restricted—such as systems that have a limit to data storage, power, or space. Between the camera lens and the detector chip array that usually collects incoming light to create the image, these cameras have an additional programmable array. This array compresses all the light from the scene into a single pixel. This means that the saved image is just one pixel, instead of a grid of hundreds, which dramatically reduces data and power usages. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In the past, researchers have struggled with finding the optimal way to get needed information back out of that one pixel. Untangling the whole image from one pixel requires machine learning, which takes time and extensive computing power, and requires large picture datasets to “train” the machine learning algorithm. The new technique uses a different type of algorithm to bypass this step and is able to gather pertinent information without having to reconstruct the whole image from the single pixel first. The algorithm can be further programmed to detect the important information.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “The intent of the system is to detect whatever is key, say a human and where they move, while being able to ignore other things, like where a tree is or when a cat crosses the street,” said Pavan Turaga, lead researcher on the NCSS project at the Arizona State University. “And what we’ve found in general is we can solve problems like object detection and object tracking, almost as if we had access to the full image, but at a significantly lower cost of acquiring the complete data.”  
    </p>
  
    <p>
      For surveillance uses, this new technique has the additional benefit of retaining all the information in the single pixel if a full picture needs to be reconstructed for further details. The technique also works particularly well with infrared imaging, which is dependent on much more expensive large sensor arrays than optical imagers. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Given the wide range of consumer applications, the researchers paired with Raytheon, an international defense company, through the Sensor Signal and Information Processing (SenSIP) Center. The long-standing collaboration between Raytheon Missile Systems (RMS) and the ASU SenSIP site helped the researchers optimize their new algorithm for drone and other surveillance applications, including vehicle and target tracking.  
    </p>
  
    <p class="keep-margin">
      The new technique can be applied to a wide range of cameras including wearable cameras and ones used in military equipment. The patented technique could also be adapted for use with three-dimensional healthcare images, such as MRIs. This would dramatically reduce the time required to scan patients, saving medical costs and waiting periods.

      Singling out a diseased or mutated cell and identifying which treatment option is most effective can be cumbersome, expensive, and time-consuming. Currently, the process involves having a centralized lab with large robotic systems to test various solutions.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      A team of researchers have discovered a way to get test results on individual cells in hours, not days, and at a fraction of the cost. Fast and affordable drug testing increases the potential for personalized treatments. Their work is a part of the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/center-for-advanced-design-and-man-of-integrated-microfluidics">Center for Advanced Design and Manufacturing of Integrated Microfluidics (CADMIM)</a>, an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) funded by the National Science Foundation.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The research team is leveraging microfluidics—technologies for manipulating tiny amounts of fluids—to enclose a single cell into a droplet of fluid for testing. Droplet microfluidics occur on computer chip-like devices, explained Abraham Lee, lead investigator and a biomedical engineer at University of California, Irvine. Electric currents zip across a chip through channels. With microfluidics, fluids flow through microchannels that are 1-100 microns wide (a human red blood cell is about 5 microns, while a sheet of paper is about 100 microns thick).
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The team used microfluidics to put a cell into a droplet of reagent (a chemical or drug), along with a bead that acts like a mini barcode for the combination. “We call it the 1-1-1 technology,” said Lee. “It’s like its own little test tube.” The new technology allows researchers to quickly screen libraries of chemical compounds, leading to more rapid drug screenings. The process would ultimately lower the lab footprint, automate much of the experiment, and lower drug development costs.

    <h3>Increasing the 1-1-1 Efficiency</h3>
  
    <p>
      In the past, cancer research meant taking a sample of a tumor, grinding it up, and performing tests on the cell slurry. The research results reflected the average of all cells in the sample, not just the cancer cells.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Over the past decade, researchers discovered how to hone in on a single—possibly problematic—cell, allowing them to test which treatments worked best on that cell. “Droplet microfluidics allows you to actually separate out single cells into these droplets without killing the cell,” said Lee.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      1-1-1 technology enables researchers to observe how a cell will react in different conditions—useful when tailoring treatments for a patient. But the same micro channels that allow for precise cell encapsulation are the very thing that hampered efficiency and cost at larger scales.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Lee explained that backups occurred as cells traveled through microchannels. Picture people standing in line to board a bus—if everyone tries to get on at the same time, sometimes multiple people board at once, and sometimes none get on. The cells behaved the same way when trying to get into a droplet, leaving it blank.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “You can end up burning through expensive reagents or it takes a very long time to get all the cells into droplets,” said Lee, adding that the pile up meant that the process was only about 10% efficient.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Lee and his team found that if they created certain circumstances—positioning the cell just right and ensuring a perfect current flow—the cell would be sucked into the channels one at a time. Their method raised encapsulation to 50% efficiency.

    </figure>
  
    <h3>Single Cells Research and Cell Communication</h3>
  
    <p>
      Understanding how cells communicate with each other has implications for certain diseases, like cancer. For example, with cancer immunotherapy treatments, doctors try to boost the immune system of a patient to target specific infections or diseased cells. The technology can evolve from single cell research to putting multiple cells into close proximity, or even in the same droplet.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “This process is still very difficult to study because you need a healthy cell that’s in the act of doing some sort of defense process,” said Lee. Using droplet bead technologies, scientists can put immunity T-cells with the problematic cell and study the interactions and responses.
    </p>

      Energy sustainability represents one of the grand challenges facing modern society, and thin-film solar photovoltaics provide one of the best opportunities for rapidly expanding renewable energy use. Photovoltaics (PV) using the thin-film semi­conductor cadmium telluride (CdTe) have been commercialized at the gigawatts (GW)-per-year scale, with 17.5 GWs installed globally.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In many utility-scale applications, it is less expensive to generate electricity using CdTe PV than fossil fuels. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from CdTe PV is ~$0.04/kWh, while the national average LCOE from all sources is $0.11/kWh. Furthermore, the lifecycle emissions of the heavy metal Cd from CdTe PV are lower than those from traditional electricity generation for the same amount of energy generated. CdTe uses approximately one one-hundredth the amount of semiconductor materials used for c-silicon PV (the most common PV in use today) and can be processed 24 times faster than c-silicon.

          (Figure 1) Researchers at Colorado State Univ. have created a roadmap of device structures for CdTe PV performance. Thus far, they have achieved efficiencies of 19.2%.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </a>
  
    <p>
      To further reduce the cost of electricity from CdTe PV, Colorado State Univ. (CSU) researchers and partners at the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/next-generation-photovoltaics">Center for Next Generation Photovoltaics</a>, an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center funded by the National Science Foundation, developed a performance roadmap (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). Progress since 2014 has been marked by three advances to the basic cell structure of CdTe PV. The progress was possible thanks to advanced device processing capabilities developed at CSU combined with state-of-the-art materials characterization by its partners.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The first advance was the replacement of the traditional CdS emitter layer with magnesium-doped zinc oxide (MZO). MZO has a higher bandgap that allows more photons to reach the CdTe absorber. In addition, MZO has conduction-band offset that helps reduce interfacial recombination, thereby preserving the voltage.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      A second improvement in 2016 was the incorporation of a Te layer at the back of (below) the CdTe, which yielded an improved contact and higher efficiency. These improvements allowed the CSU PV’s efficiency to reach 18.3% (independently certified) in 2016.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The largest breakthrough, however, was the introduction of an alloy layer of CdTe and CdSe (CdSeTe) in front of the CdTe. One advantage of the CdSeTe layer is its smaller bandgap, which enables it to produce more current. More importantly, however, it has a much longer recombination lifetime than CdTe, and it appears to form an electric field in the favorable direction at the transition to CdTe. These characteristics together have moved the cell voltage about 80 mV closer to the bandgap, and efficiency at CSU labs (without an antireflective [AR] coating) reached 19.2% in 2017.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In addition to the high cell efficiencies, the CSU team has built CdTe structures to lay the foundation for the next performance breakthrough. For example, the structures have achieved lifetimes of photogenerated electrons above 1,000 nanoseconds, compared to <10 nanoseconds in most CdTe cells. In addition, CSU’s structures demonstrate interfacial recombination velocities less than 80 cm/sec, compared to typical values above 104 cm/sec. Concurrently, partners at Washington State Univ. and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have achieved doping levels for holes in CdTe above 1016 cm–3, which is much greater than the typical mid-1014 cm–3 range.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      These achievements pave a clear path toward even higher cell efficiencies, and make 25% a realistic near-term (3-year) goal and 30% a reachable long-term goal. The efficiency gains will lead to lower LCOE from CdTe PV. In addition, the research at CSU is performed on pilot-scale systems, which can be readily translated to industrial manufacturing.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “The researchers at CSU maintain a close coupling between laboratory research and what is commercially impactful,” says Markus Gloeckler, Chief Scientist at First Solar. First Solar is the largest manufacturer of CdTe PV modules.

    Catalyzing Commercialization: Novel Concrete Wall Panels Lower a Building’s Energy Footprint

    About 20% of total energy consumption in the U.S. is used for the heating and cooling of buildings using conventional sources like fossil fuels.

      About 20% of total energy consumption in the U.S. is used for the heating and cooling of buildings using conventional sources like fossil fuels. While standard thermal insulation, with its low thermal conductivity, can help mitigate heating/cooling loss, researchers have sought to incorporate thermal storage capacity within the building envelope to better control the temperature variations across building walls.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Previous attempts to do so have relied on mixing a phase-change material (PCM) like petroleum wax into the cement paste. The wax would absorb heat during a hot period and release stored heat during a cold period, thereby significantly reducing the temperature variation inside the building. Unfortunately, this approach has not succeeded in becoming a commercial reality due to technical challenges.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      A new method developed by scientists at the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/center-for-energy-harvesting-materials-and-system">Center for Energy Harvesting Materials and Systems (CEHMS)</a> at Columbia Univ., part of the National Science Foundation’s Industry-University Cooperative Research Centers program, promises to overcome these challenges.
    </p>
  
    <figure>
      <img alt="Wall panel" src="site.baseurl/visuals/achievements/wall_panel.png">
      <figcaption>
        (a) A novel wall panel consists of foamed concrete with a (b) micropore structure that is filled with a phase-change material (PCM). The PCM can absorb heat during warm periods and release heat during cold periods, helping to regulate a building’s temperature. (c) A higher porosity corresponds to less temperature fluctuation.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <p>
      The CEHMS team used a multiscale modeling method to guide the design and manufacture of PCM wall panels. The end result was a lightweight wall panel that has a relatively uniform microporous structure — with up to 75% porosity — that retains adequate structural strength to meet the required building codes for non-structural use.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The team developed a mixing process that involves the application of pressure and the addition of foaming surfactants, which generate microsized air bubbles in the cement paste. By modulating the process conditions, they can control the microstructure and porosity of the concrete. Typically, it is very difficult to control the generation of uniform microstructure and porosity in concrete; a standard concrete has only 7% porosity. Using their novel process, the researchers have created materials that have porosities as high as 83%.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Next, they embedded polymer fibers and metal mesh into the cement for reinforcement. After curing the concrete in a mold, the micropores are filled with PCM by vacuum infusion. The PCM-filled capillary pores provide thermal energy storage while the polymer fibers in the composite provide adequate strength (3.3 MPa) to support the workload in service and installation.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The phase-change wall panel can suppress room temperature fluctuations and significantly reduce the energy needed to heat and cool a room. Lab tests and numerical simulations demonstrate that a 1-in.-thick wall panel with 70% PCM embedment could shrink the electricity demand of a 1,000-ft2 home in the U.S. Northeast by ~50% in the summer months. Larger-scale applications could improve energy efficiency of buildings even more and reduce their heating/cooling-related carbon footprint. The novel foam concrete exhibits better thermal and acoustic properties than standard thermal insulation, as well as good mechanical properties. Such wall panels could represent a sustainable and energy-efficient way to combat climate change. In addition to its use as an energy-efficient wall panel, the novel concrete could also be used in building-integrated photovoltaic thermal roof panels.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The organization is now looking to create customized wall panels for specific climates that would contain several PCMs with tuned melting temperatures. “This technology could be a game-changer, bringing deep energy savings at an affordable price to the energy-efficient building envelope market,” says Orin Herskowitz, Columbia Technology Ventures Director. Columbia Univ. is working with a startup to license and further drive commercial development of this technology.

    Catalyzing Commercialization: Novel Palladium-Graphene Catalysts Improve Pharmaceutical Processing

    Pharmaceutical companies use a variety of metal catalysts to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

These reactions traditionally employ homogeneous palladium catalysts, which often require extensive purification to separate the catalyst from the product.

      Pharmaceutical companies use a variety of metal catalysts to produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). One of the most widely used catalytic reactions in commercial operation is the Suzuki cross-coupling reaction, which can produce high-volume drugs such as the anti-hypertension drug losartan. These reactions traditionally employ homogeneous palladium catalysts, which often require extensive purification to separate the catalyst from the product.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Heterogeneous, or solid-supported, catalysts have supports that serve mainly as relatively large platforms for the nanoscale palladium catalysts, and the supports can be easily separated out. Pharmaceutical companies are developing heterogeneous catalysts to reduce overall API manufacturing costs. However, the challenge in developing solid-supported catalysts is preventing the leaching of palladium from the solid surface to avoid product contamination.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Researchers at Virginia Commonwealth Univ. in Richmond, VA, and at the Univ. of South Carolina in Columbia, SC, have developed an innovative method to produce extremely active heterogeneous palladium catalysts with precise control of palladium loading. This new method combines strong electrostatic adsorption (SEA) metal deposition with microwave (MW) irradiation (SEA-MW) to produce these highly reactive catalysts.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In the SEA-MW process, scientists adjust the pH of an ionic palladium precursor solution to either protonate or deprotonate the graphene surface. This directs the graphene support to uptake, or electrostatically adsorb, the ionic palladium precursor onto its surface. Then, a solventless MW irradiation treatment simultaneously forms palladium nanoparticles (1–3 nm) and creates holes or defects in the graphene sheet. Computational and experimental research shows that these holes, or defects, in the graphene enhance catalytic activity and palladium binding. In addition, the research shows the graphene material effectively serves as a charge reservoir and actively assists in charge donation and acceptance steps throughout the Suzuki reaction. These results strongly suggest that the graphene materials act as a solid-state ligand that can assist in catalysis and still be easily separated out.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The SEA-MW method forms ultrasmall palladium nanoparticles and clusters. Both forms are supported by graphene defects, via three scenarios:
  
      <ul>
        <li>
          Pre-existing graphene defects or holes support the palladium nanoparticles and clusters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Protonated or deprotonated oxygen functional groups take up ionic palladium complexes. Microwave irradiation then simultaneously removes carbon and oxygen (as CO or CO2) to create graphene defects and form palladium nanoparticles. The close proximity of the recently formed nanoparticles and graphene defect allows the nanoparticles to bind strongly to the graphene defect.
        </li>
        <li>
          Graphene’s protonated pi bonds (in the middle of the honeycomb-like lattice of the aromatic rings, away from oxygen and away from edges) take up the ionic palladium complexes. During the microwave irradiation step, the palladium very strongly absorbs the energy and grows hot enough to directly burn, or pyrolyze, holes in the graphene support.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The SEA-MW catalysts exhibit catalytic activities 16 times higher than commercially available palladium-on-carbon catalysts. This improvement could allow manufacturers to reduce the use of expensive palladium and lower the overall price of the pharmaceutical drug. In addition, the process does not require solvents or reducing agents. Other advantages of the SEA-MW method include the use of low MW powers (50–150 W), short reaction times (10 min), and atmospheric reaction conditions. Also, metal contamination is minimized because the palladium nanoclusters are tightly bound to the relatively large graphene surfaces, which can be easily filtered from the reaction mixture.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Although the SEA-MW method holds great promise in pharmaceutical catalysis, the cost of graphene materials can be a concern. However, this method has been demonstrated on four different types of graphene materials, including graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs), which are significantly more cost-effective (< $1/g) than other graphene materials. The researchers — who are part of the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/center-for-rational-catalyst-synthesis">Center for Rational Catalyst Synthesis (CeRCaS)</a>, an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) — are currently working with the CeRCaS member companies (Biogen, Boehringer Ingelheim, and ThalesNano) to commercialize these materials.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Richard Jones, an executive with ThalesNano, says, “We have found these graphene-supported palladium catalysts to possess remarkable catalytic activity, and we are currently evaluating how they can be integrated into our product line.”

    <p>
      Sourcing uncommon minerals needed to make common products just got a whole lot easier. A research team at the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/center-for-resource-recovery-and-recycling">Center for Resource Recovery and Recycling (CR3)</a>, one of the four research centers under Worcester Polytechnic Institutes (WPI) <a target="_blank" href="https://wp.wpi.edu/mpi/research-centers/">Metal Processing Institute</a>, developed a simple, eco-friendly method for extracting so-called rare earth metals from old electric motors and generators. The technique promotes a circular economy and reduces the need to buy rare earth minerals, where prices can fluctuate widely. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “If we can close the loop on materials that are precious and technologically relevant, we’ll see many benefits in terms of sustainability,” says lead chemist Marion Emmert of Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
    </p>

    <h3>Reversing a Wasteful Trend</h3>
  
    <p>
      Although the average consumer may have never heard of rare earth metals, such as yttrium, praseodymium, neodymium, and dysprosium, they’re found in familiar products, such as cell phones, electronic devices, rechargeable batteries, magnets, fluorescent lights, and electric motors and generators. But acquiring these minerals isn’t easy because the United States lacks large mineable deposits of rare earths and manufacturers must rely on imports from foreign markets.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      At the same time, manufacturers are motivated to reuse materials that would otherwise go to waste. General Motors, for instance, approached CR3 — an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center funded by the National Science Foundation to make products sustainable from design through end-of-life — looking for a way to recover rare earth metals from electric motors. Although a system already existed to dismantle, shred, and recycle steel, copper, aluminum and other common car parts, no one had figured out how to recycle electric motors. “The rare earths were essentially being thrown away,” says Emmert.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      While brainstorming a solution, Emmert, a college professor of organic and inorganic chemistry, recalled a classroom activity that asked students to classify metals based on their potential to be dissolved in mineral acids. She already knew, for instance, that gold, silver and copper did not react with these acids and she wondered if rare earth metals might. Sure enough, searching on YouTube, she found videos dissolving rare earth metals in weak acids.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      It raised a question, says Emmert: “Can we find conditions under which we can dissolve just the rare earth-containing materials, while keeping intact other metals, such as copper and steel that are valuable in their own right?”
    </p>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <h3>Common Chemical Closes the Loop</h3>
  
    <p>
      Using small samples of rare earth magnets, the researchers started experimenting with different concentrations of a variety of acids, including acetic, sulfuric, nitric, formic, and hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid, a chemical found in some toilet bowl cleaners, worked the best. By collaborating with their WPI colleagues in mechanical and materials engineering, they first baked an electric motor from a Chevy Spark, about the size of a gallon milk jug, in an industrial oven at 450 degrees Celsius. The temperature disrupted the magnetic field of the material, demagnetizing it and making it easier to handle.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Next, they put the motor through an industrial shredder, which spit out one-inch bits of steel, copper, iron, and other metals still covered in rare earth minerals. They mixed the bits in a bucket with diluted hydrochloric acid and let it sit for a couple of hours. Filtering out the metal parts revealed a grass-green liquid. To that, they added oxalic acid, an organic compound found in plants. It reacted with the rare earth elements and turned them to powder. The powder of rare earth oxides can be used as an ingredient for new electric motors. To fully close the recycling loop, the scientists distilled the hydrochloric acid to remove remaining bits of iron and boron, so that the acid could be used again.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Emmert and her colleagues received a patent on the process and have also investigated ways to commercialize it. Building a recycling center that exclusively focuses on electric motors and wind turbine generators could make a U.S.-based rare earth supply chain circular and profitable, boosting sustainable energy generation. They are raising funds to develop the first pilot plant that would create a closed loop rare earths system that would benefit not just General Motors, but other automotive companies and electric motor manufacturers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      “There are only so many rare earth elements to go around,” says Emmert.

      Aluminum (Al) possesses many desirable properties: a high strength-to-weight ratio, corrosion resistance, thermal conductivity, and ductility. Over the past five decades, Al and its alloys have been used extensively for automotive, construction, electrical, and chemical applications. The growing demand for Al is met with an increase in demand for bauxite, a native ore for primary Al production.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Alumina (Al2O3) is leached from bauxite ore using the Bayer process, which also generates a residue called red mud. Red mud is a complex mineralogical mixture of primarily iron, aluminum, and titanium oxides in addition to some high-value rare-earth elements. For every ton of aluminum produced from bauxite, nearly 2.5–4 tons of red mud is produced. Since the advent of the Bayer process in the late 1800s, over 3 billion tons of red mud have been accumulated and stored in red mud ponds. The production of red mud, which recently reached 130 million tons per year, is expected to grow annually by about 6%.
    </p>
  
    <figure>
      <img alt="red mud" src="site.baseurl/visuals/achievements/mud.jpg">
      <figcaption>
        Researchers have developed a process for recovering metals with over 80% reduction in red mud waste — a hazardous byproduct of aluminum production that must be stored in holding ponds, such as this one.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <p>
      The caustic nature and fine particle size of red mud makes the residue hazardous and expensive to contain. Despite attempts to reuse red mud and its constituents, so far commercial utilization of red mud has not been viable due to techno-economic challenges as well as lack of regulations.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) researchers affiliated with the <a href="https://iucrc.nsf.gov/centers/center-for-resource-recovery-and-recycling">Center for Resource Recovery and Recycling (CR3)</a>, an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), have developed a metallurgical process to extract iron oxide and rare-earth elements from red mud. The proprietary process can use red mud slurries directly from the Bayer process.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      First, the slurries enter a hydro-metallurgical leaching process to selectively extract iron, aluminum, and titanium. Then, a solid-liquid precipitation mechanism is used to selectively precipitate iron. Finally, the precipitated residue is converted into magnetite nanoparticles. Magnetite nanoparticles are extensively used in magnetically assisted drug delivery agents, pigments, fertilizers, and magnetic drives. In addition, the process offers a way to extract aluminum, titanium, and rare-earth elements (primarily scandium [Sc] and yttrium [Y]), which creates further value.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The new process overcomes many technical challenges, is more environmentally sustainable than storing red mud in ponds, and can be set up on-site at refineries, which reduces transportation costs. And, it can use slurries directly from the Bayer process, which reduces the operational costs incurred in drying the red mud (27% loss on ignition) that is required in competing pyrometallurgical strategies. Pyro-metallurgical processes use carbon or CO gas at high temperatures to produce magnetite with much lower purity due to lack of selectivity. Costs can be further reduced by repurposing the new process’s reagents via acid recovery.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Using the new metallurgical process, a plant processing 100,000 tons of red mud annually will produce 31,000 tons of magnetite nanoparticles at 99.9% purity. The new process can produce magnetite nanoparticles at a low temperature of around 70°C, which offers a competitive advantage over current high-temperature pyro-processes that require temperatures above 600°C.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Competing processes have higher operational costs than the new process because they require a pure-grade precursor material, such as iron dichloride or iron(II) sulfate, to produce magnetite nanoparticles. In fact, after an economic analysis, the researchers found the new process had operational costs that were 46% lower than those of a competing process to produce magnetite nanoparticles and capital costs that were 52% lower. These economic projections are expected to improve dramatically if the extraction of other liberated elements, such as Sc, Y, Al, and Ti, is taken into account. This new metallurgical process is a promising, environmentally sustainable, and profitable means to close the loop in primary aluminum production.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In 2017, one of CR3’s industrial members, Global Mineral Recovery, Inc. (GMR), in partnership with Rio Tinto, launched a large-scale commercial venture to deliver a complete reclamation of bauxite residue into useful minerals, metallic oxides, and Earth-friendly materials. “This seminal research in CR3 will be pivotal to the success of GMR,” says GMR president Paul S. Kennedy. The joint venture will use technologies developed by the CR3 researchers at WPI to separate red mud into its components and to completely recycle and commercialize the resulting products.

      Healthcare wearables are a booming industry, and many devices have been developed for the elderly to detect falls. But identifying a fall after it has occurred could be too late. Falls are the leading cause of death in older Americans, and for those injured, the medical costs are expected to reach $67.7 billion by the end of 2020, according to the National Council on Aging.  
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Now for the first time, researchers have developed an app for iPhones that uses the same motion-sensing instruments the phone has for navigation screen orientation to monitor a person’s activity, determine their risk for falling and alert caregivers, if needed. The Lockhart Monitor, developed by biomedical engineer Thurmon Lockhart, a professor at Arizona State University, tracks everyday balance and walking abilities and—in early tests with elderly, orthopedic, and obese patients—accurately predicted fall risks. In an unexpected outcome, Lockhart also found that the app could also be used to monitor a person’s state of mind, he says, because previous studies have shown that the same movements that correlate with fall risk are tightly linked to depression and fatigue.

      “Health preservation of our elderly population hinges upon our ability to accurately predict fall risks prior to a fall event and quickly target interventions to improve stability,” says Lockhart, who developed the technology as part of a research collaboration with The Core Institute, an orthopedic and musculoskeletal healthcare facility, an industry partner in the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/building-reliable-advances-and-innovations-in-neurotechnology">Center for Building Reliable Innovation and Advances in Neurotechnology (BRAIN)</a>. This Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) is funded by the National Science Foundation to develop safe, effective and affordable personalized neurotechnologies that diagnose, restore, and enhance mind and body functions. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Lockhart says his own father’s death as the result of a fall inspired him to develop the app. He and his team built the technology for Apple iPhones, which users can wear in a pocket or on a belt clip. As the person goes about their day, their phone’s motion-sensing instruments captures speed and stability data. An algorithm written by the team members and embedded in the app uses data from the sensor to establish a baseline of motion for the user and then track variabilities in gait and posture. When the motion falls outside the normal range, the phone issues an alert in the form of a text message to a designated caregiver.  
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In 2017, the researchers began testing the app’s underlying algorithm with patients who had undergone joint or back surgery and hip replacements. The team found that people who fell were those who had, perhaps counterintuitively, moved more slowly and showed less variability in their gait and posture than those who didn’t fall. In fact, people who didn’t fall moved more quickly and had more variability in their actions. The researchers didn’t have an explanation for why but follow up studies on people with obesity and osteoporosis showed similar results.  
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Looking for clues, the scientists read dozens of unrelated published studies that dealt with gait and posture and found the same slow gaits and movements found in people at risk of falling were also found in those with depression and fatigue. “Depression and mobility are closely related, and in assessing such relationships, we are able to determine and quantify this complexity,” says Lockhart. It meant that the researchers could use their phone app to detect not only potential fall risk, but also depression and fatigue. Lockhart says his team is currently planning to validate the cognitive behavioral monitor at a local active-living center for older adults. The study will involve a baseline measure and subsequent daily measures while patients are wearing the mobile phone for up to 100 days, he says.

    </figure>
  
    <p>
      Lockhart credits the BRAIN Center in large part for his success. “Collaborating with the BRAIN Center not only helped me to validate the device but also helped me to realize what intellectual property was worth commercializing,” he says.  
    </p>
  
    <p>
      At the moment, the team is currently developing future studies to test the technology on people with depression and they’re also working on specific interventions for post-surgical patients who may be at risk for falling. For instance, in cases where the technology senses that a person’s gait or posture is falling outside of normal range, the app may issue an alert to the patient as well as to a caregiver. Then, depending on the patient’s treatment plan, the app would suggest an exercise or physical therapy intervention to improve the person’s stability.  
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “In the future, this technology could be wearable and monitor mobility, gait, posture, and physiological indicators or be non-invasive, for instance, be embedded in floors and walls of homes,” says Lockhart.

    Catalyzing Commercialization: Solar Paper Powers Internet-of-Things Devices

    Today’s solar cells are mainly used for large-scale power production. However, the up-and-coming internet of things (IoT) will require many sensors and devices to transmit information wirelessly to computer networks and mobile personal electronics. Those sensors and devices could be powered with solar cells that harvest energy from either freely available sunlight or indoor lighting, provided the solar cells are small, inexpensive, lightweight, and able to conform and adhere to surfaces with any shape or texture.

      Today’s solar cells are mainly used for large-scale power production. However, the up-and-coming internet of things (IoT) will require many sensors and devices to transmit information wirelessly to computer networks and mobile personal electronics. Those sensors and devices could be powered with solar cells that harvest energy from either freely available sunlight or indoor lighting, provided the solar cells are small, inexpensive, lightweight, and able to conform and adhere to surfaces with any shape or texture.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      To address the need for a new type of solar cell, an interdisciplinary team of chemical engineers, botanists, and artists is developing a paper solar cell technology that can be mounted on nearly any surface. The team is conducting its research through the Industry University Cooperative Research <a href="site.baseurl/centers/next-generation-photovoltaics">Center for Next Generation Photovoltaics (NGPV IUCRC)</a>, established in 2010 with support from the National Science Foundation to advance industrially relevant, pre-competitive research.
    </p>

      <figcaption>
        A thin piece of cellulose paper containing 10 solar cells can withstand folding and bending (left), which makes it good for applications such as wearable devices (right).
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <p>
      The team, led by Brian Korgel, Vikas Reddy, and James Sham at the Univ. of Texas at Austin, recently demonstrated paper solar cells with efficiencies of 2.25%, which is the highest yet reported for devices fabricated directly on paper. The paper devices have exceptional mechanical and electrical integrity, are stable in air, and retain their performance when bent or even folded and unfolded multiple times across the active area of the device.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The solar cell technology involves a combination of nanocellulose paper cultivated by bacteria and a semiconducting nanocrystal ink. A scalable process harnesses the bacterium Gluconacetobacter hansenii to produce dense nanocellulose membranes that are processed into paper. The nanoporous structure of the paper enables exceptional adhesion of the device layers and mitigates the impact of bending stresses that typically cause these brittle layers to crack.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The semiconducting (light-harvesting) layer is also critical to the mechanical flexibility and integrity of the overall paper device. It prevents crack propagation on the nano-cellulose paper and stabilizes the entire device stack when it is bent or folded. The researchers produce the light-harvesting films by spray-depositing an ink of colloidal nanocrystals composed of copper-indium-diselenide (CuInSe2) onto the paper substrate. The nanocrystals are made via readily available solution-based chemical processes and materials. The composition of CuInSe2 is similar to copper-indium-gallium-selenide (CIGS), which is commercially used in high-efficiency thin-film photov-oltaics; however, the CuInSe2 nano-crystal devices perform better without the addition of gallium, which is expensive and makes the cost of CIGS a barrier for many applications.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Several industrial partners of NGPV IUCRC, including Boeing, Novacentrix, Emcore, Statoil, First Solar, EMD/Millipore, Big Solar Ltd., and Lucelo, have shown interest in the nanocrystal inks and their use to enable new kinds of solar cells.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Ray Lewandowski, head of U.S. operations and development at Big Solar Ltd., says, “It has been exciting to watch the nanocrystal ink technology develop during these past few years. The research team is poised to achieve efficiencies that will open a number of commercial opportunities.”
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “The emerging IoT requires inexpensive remote power,” says Paul Thurk of ARCH Venture Partners. “The paper solar cell technology developed by Korgel’s team could meet many of these needs.”
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The researchers have created prototypes with 10 small-area photovoltaics (PVs) integrated on a single piece of paper to generate 1.5 V under indoor fluorescent lighting and operate several voltage-driven devices, including liquid crystal displays (LCDs). Prototypes include adhesive strips and decorative wearables, as well as a monolithic form that can be integrated with data-collecting devices.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The new solar-cell devices must be about 2.5 in.2 to generate sufficient power from indoor lighting to power most IoT applications. Efficiencies closer to 5% would allow for the use of smaller devices (1.0 in.2) and lower the costs to a projected $0.03 per device.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The power-to-weight ratios of the paper solar cells are similar to those of high-efficiency single-crystal silicon and multijunction III-V solar cells, although the power output of the paper devices is much lower due to low device currents.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The team is working to improve efficiency and demonstrate the low-cost integration of the paper PVs into emerging IoT sensor technologies.

    What's In A Name? A New Tool For Finding Sustainable Pesticides

      A new way to name certain proteins is a potential gamechanger for researchers developing organic pesticides that target specific insects, which are more environmentally friendly than chemically-based alternatives.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The new naming system—which will replace its predecessor from the 1990s—along with a newly established resource center, will streamline work and increase efficiency in finding and identifying proteins.
    </p>
  
    <figure>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <h3>A Streamlined System</h3>
  
    <p>
      The naming system is specific to proteins produced by bacteria that are used in pesticides. Today, there are hundreds of these pesticidal proteins—many more than the original naming system was designed to handle. As the number of newly identified proteins continues to rise, a new information resource was needed to help scientists sort through all the proteins and find ones useful to their applications.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Bryony Bonning of the University of Florida, along with colleagues Neil Crickmore of the University of Sussex (who developed the previous system), Colin Berry of Cardiff University, and Suresh Pannerselvam of the University of Florida, designed a new system that describes the structure of the protein in its name. Their work was conducted as part of the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/center-for-arthropod-management-technologies">Center for Arthropod Management Technologies (CAMTech)</a>, an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) funded by the National Science Foundation.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Proteins have tremendous variation in their structure. Since their structure is related to their function, the shape of pesticidal proteins can predict what insects they might act against or whether they might interact with other proteins. The research team used this relationship between structure and function in the protein’s name by developing a system that puts pesticidal proteins into groups distinguished by shape. With the new system, researchers can infer what type of pesticide might be made with a protein just based on its name.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “It will really help the field,” said one of the project leads, Bryony Bonning, a researcher at the University of Florida whose research is funded by the IUCRC program. “It will speed things up, particularly with the immense number of pesticidal proteins being identified now with advanced gene sequencing technologies.”
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Researchers around the world study different strains of <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> and other pesticidal-producing bacteria in order to identify new proteins that can be used to create improved pesticides. This work also helps researchers bioengineer plants to produce their own bacteria-derived pesticidal proteins that protect the crops from pests.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      To ensure the new naming system would be beneficial to a wide range of users, it was developed in collaboration with industry partners and has also been presented to government agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “We didn’t come up with this system alone,” Bonning said. “Neil presented the idea multiple times at different meetings and got feedback from industry representatives and other academics. It was definitely an iterative process with the naming system refined with input from industry.”
    </p>

    </figure>
  
    <h3>New Resource Center</h3>
  
    <p>
      The new pesticidal protein naming system now has its own online database. Called the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bpprc.org/">Bacterial Pesticidal Protein Resource Center</a>, researchers can access the website to look up proteins, cross-reference old names with new ones, and submit new proteins to be named. To date, there are over 1,000 pesticidal proteins in the system.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “The extraordinary number and diversity of pesticidal proteins coming from microbial genomes and metagenomes was overwhelming our capacity to deal with them,” said collaborator Jim Baum, a researcher at Bayer. The sheer number of proteins made it hard for the industry to work with, so they strongly supported funding this project to create a more usable system.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Along with old and new names, the database also contains information on protein structures for those that are publicly available. For newly discovered proteins that industry wants to remain secret for patented use, the database also has a private submission option. The database and protein analysis tools can also be downloaded from the site for remote use.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Ultimately, the new system will increase efficiency by making it easier to swiftly identify proteins of particular interest. The resource center will increase awareness of the diversity of these pesticidal proteins and help researchers share their knowledge. The system has also been largely automated to speed up and ease the naming process as new proteins are being discovered at an increasing pace.

    Test Helps ‘Rubber Meet the Road’ in Wet Driving Conditions

      More than 300,000 people are injured and about 4,000 die each year in car crashes that occur on roads with wet pavement, according to the <a target="_blank" href="https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/weather/q1_roadimpact.htm">U.S. Department of Transportation</a>. Although no one can control the rain, they can improve the tires that drive on slick surfaces. Dr. Siamak Farhad, an Associate Professor of Mechanical Engineering department at The University of Akron, and his research team have developed a system they call dynamic mechanical analysis that, for the first time, directly and accurately stress tests new materials that go into making tires. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “The new test could increase wet traction of tires,” says Farhad. “That’s a significant impact to society and the economy because it reduces the number accidents and deaths.” 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Farhad developed the test at the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/center-for-tire-research">Center for Tire Research (CenTiRe)</a> — an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to conduct leading-edge research in materials, tire physics, testing and manufacturing.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Conventional test systems fall short</h3>
  
    <p>
      Until now, directly and accurately testing rubber materials in the laboratory under conditions that simulate wet traction has been nearly impossible. Because tire materials have properties that make them both elastic like a spring and viscous like honey, testing them requires equipment that can vibrate samples across a broad range of frequencies. That means applying forces from gradual compression and expansion (low frequency) to more rapid impulses (high frequency). 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Machines cannot run at a wide range of frequencies and when they try to run at high frequencies, the testing machines experience mechanical vibrations that interfere with sensors. Most testing systems attempt to overcome this limitation by changing the temperature of a material in order to simulate the effects of high frequency. Called time temperature superposition, or TTS, this approach leads to inaccuracies, Farhad says. 
    </p>
  
    <h3>Quickly and accurately testing rubber materials for tires has been nearly impossible—until now</h3>
  
    <p>
      The dynamic mechanical analysis system overcomes both of these challenges. It runs at a wide range of frequencies and can achieve elusive high frequencies, without experiencing vibrations. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “Tire rubber is not homogeneous, and application of TTS is an approximation. Farhad’s work allows us to test material responses directly, without TTS. This is the main technical breakthrough,” says Mindaugas Rackaitis, industrial advisory board chair of CenTiRe and the manager of advanced materials research at Akron, Ohio-based Bridgestone Americas.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      What’s more, the device can produce results in less than an hour. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “This is the main technical breakthrough,” says Rackaitis. “Economically, running TTS for one sample might take several hours, whereas with this new measurement method, it could possibly be done faster than 30 minutes.” 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Rackaitis says that the ability to test materials accurately at a high frequency could have broad implications for developing materials beyond tires. Researchers that work on products designed for impact resistance, sound propagation, packaging and more would be interested in this device.
    </p>
  
    <h3>The size of a shoebox</h3>

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <p>
      The test system is about the size of a shoebox and it applies high-frequency perturbations to two small pieces of viscoelastic material, less than 0.2” x 0.2” each, without disrupting system sensors or dislodging the samples. Farhad and his research team built it with inexpensive and commercially available technologies from today’s market, including a force sensor and a mover called an actuator, which is integrated with sensors. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Although the components were readily available, the system’s design was not. Farhad and his research team spent a year-and-a-half with computer modeling software to come up with a configuration that would produce no vibrations and minimized temperature increases when running samples at high frequencies. After working through 50 different designs, they invented a unique clamp mechanism that holds the samples and a sturdy base that produces no resonance. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      During that time, Farhad and Esmaeeli conferenced biweekly, either by video or in person, with 20 industry partners to present their progress, solicit feedback, and brainstorm solutions to problems. The combination of technology and human ingenuity paid off. When the researchers finally built a working device and tested it on samples, the system worked on the first try. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Dr. Ron Kennedy, the CenTiRe Managing Director, who helped coordinate collaborators between Farhad’s research team and industry members, says that a great advantage of the NSF IUCRC program is that it encourages faculty, students, and industry members to work together to develop technology through a mentoring relationship. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “Farhad and his students took great advantage of the mentoring provided by experts at the CenTiRe member companies to better define the technical requirements and application needs for the test equipment. This resulted in the development of test equipment that will directly address the needs of the member companies, and in turn the driving public,” Kennedy says. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The team has filed a <a target="_blank" href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190017912A1/en">U.S. patent</a> for their test device, but will be working to add a control chamber that can run a variety of viscoelastic material samples at different temperatures. Farhad says the team hopes to have a commercially viable product in spring 2021.

Electrochemical sensors are compatible with integrated circuit technology, enabling integration of sensors with the necessary electronic circuitry for data acquisition, processing, and transfer.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as graphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and their heterostructures, are viable candidates for fabricating electrochemical biosensors due to their tunable electronic properties and the abundance of functionalization strategies. Recent progress in low-temperature and low-cost synthesis of 2D materials through electrodeposition could allow such biosensors to be printed at high throughput on flexible substrates for integration in wearable technologies.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Researchers at Penn State Univ. (PSU) and Rice Univ. affiliated with the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/atomically-thin-multifunctional-coatings">Center for Atomically Thin Multifunctional Coatings (ATOMIC)</a>, an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center, are exploring 2D materials for applications in electrochemical biosensing. Research at ATOMIC focuses on two key areas: scalable synthesis and sensor fabrication methods for electrodeposition of TMDs; and functionalizing 2D material inks for sensor fabrication on low-cost substrates (plastic and paper).

      The researchers are modifying 2D materials via various physical and chemical routes to tune and improve the electrochemical response to target biomolecules, such as dopamine. Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter whose abnormal levels can be indicative of various neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and schizophrenia.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      A team of researchers led by Mauricio Terrones (PSU) and Aida Ebrahimi (PSU) has recently developed a low-cost detector for dopamine based on electrodeposited manganese-doped molybdenum disulfide (Mn-doped MoS2). The sensor enables detection of extremely low levels of dopamine — approximately 10 picomolar in buffer media.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In another collaboration between Air Force Research Laboratory (an ATOMIC industry member) and PSU, researchers investigated 2D material inks and their modification as a facile route for biosensor development. For example, they showed that by tuning thickness and morphology of graphene ink and its treatment under a specific low-temperature annealing condition, detection of dopamine down to a few picomolar can be achieved — the lowest reported concentration for sensors based solely on graphene.

      Beyond tuning the surface properties, the researchers also showed that the response of electrochemical biosensors can be tuned based on the substrate. For example, they showed that sensitivity of iron sulfide-graphene heterostructures to reduction of hydrogen peroxide (an important small molecule involved in cell signaling and oxidative stress) depends on the underlying graphene’s doping type and level. The substrate properties affect the interface impedance and charge-transfer kinetics, which impact the sensor’s sensitivity.

      Within the next five years, the ATOMIC researchers envision developing and expanding a variety of specific biosensors into a fully packaged sensory platform prototype. This platform would interface with a smartphone for remote control.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The research center’s long-term goal is to commercialize such a platform. Therefore, the researchers plan to seek direct input from key industrial partners on various aspects such as scalability, processing routes, and product design. Through this multipronged effort enabled by collaborations between university researchers and industrial R&D teams, the engineered sensors and integrated system can advance low-cost diagnostic technologies for applications ranging from wearable sensor arrays for human stress monitoring to smart cell-culture plates for high-throughput in vitro screening of drugs.

      Today, consumer food choices, as well as food processing innovations, are driven by health, nutrition, and sustainability considerations. Plant proteins, a sustainable alternative to meat, are being used more frequently in foods from protein bars to pasta. At the heart of many food processes is drying. Proteins are routinely dried to improve storage stability, expand alternatives to product formulation, and enhance bioavailability. However, a common challenge with drying is that proteins are sensitive to high heat and exposure times, which can denature and degrade their quality, nutritional value, and taste.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The <a href="site.baseurl/centers/center-for-advanced-research-in-drying">Center for Advanced Research in Drying (CARD)</a> has devised an alternative processing technology — i.e., ultrasound contact drying — that could mitigate problems associated with traditional drying operations. CARD is devoted to research on the drying of moist, porous materials such as food, agricultural products, chemical products, and biopharmaceuticals. Led by Worcester Polytechnic Institute and the Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, CARD is investigating the use of high-power ultrasound as a nonthermal, faster, and less energy-intensive method for protein dehydration.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Drying of heat-sensitive biological materials has been an ongoing challenge in the food-processing industry. Ultrasound contact drying is an attractive technology because it can preserve protein functionality, including solubility and enzymatic activity. In the bio-pharmaceuticals industry, the method can be used to dry delicate materials such as therapeutic and diagnostic proteins. In addition, it can be run at room temperature and offers shorter drying times than conventional drying.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In ultrasound contact drying, piezoelectric transducers produce a high-frequency sound (20–100 kHz) that creates cavitation bubbles and capillary waves in liquid water, which rupture the surface of the water. A stream of air blows away the resulting mist.
    </p>

      <figcaption>
        Ultrasound induces capillary waves at the surface of a pool or drop of water. As the waves crest, cavitation bubbles are formed. These bubbles burst from the liquid surface, releasing tiny droplets of mist that can be blown away by a stream of air. Source: Adapted from <a href="#footnote-1">(1)</a>.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <p>
      Ultrasound contact drying is more energy efficient than traditional heat-based drying. The energy consumption per unit mass of water removed in a conventional convection dryer was reported as 3.7 kJ/g, while a prototype ultrasonic dryer consumed 0.3 kJ/g. In traditional drying operations, energy usage from running ancillary equipment and energy losses can account for 50% of the total energy consumption.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      CARD tested their ultrasound contact drying process on pea and lentil proteins in small pilot-plant experiments. A thin layer of a protein gel or slurry was spread onto a drying surface, which was placed in contact with an array of ultrasound transducers housed in a transducer box. The slurry was kept at 26–28°C by a heat-exchange system. Ultrasound energy was applied for 5–8 min until the moisture content of the gel was reduced to 1.5%. The final product consisted of non-sticky thin flakes. This shows promise for scaling up the operation because the drying equipment could operate without becoming fouled with sticky residues. Protein powders made by ultrasound contact drying were readily dispersible in water and 5 to 10 times more soluble than protein powders dried through conventional means.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The design and development of pilot plant demonstration equipment is underway to further develop the ultrasonic technology to produce high-quality food products, while reducing processing time, energy consumption, and processing costs.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “One of the most important aspects of the Center’s mission is creating new technologies and tools that help our industry members build commercial success,” says Jamal Yagoobi, Lead Director of CARD.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      To that end, CARD is actively collaborating with industry groups that are developing ultrasound contact drying for various types of proteins and biopolymers processed in the food and biotech industries. Plans are underway to expand testing of this method to dry other protein products, including α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and insulin.

      Keeping your clam chowder chock full of tasty <em>Arctica</em> islandica clams (i.e., quahogs), the type of clams used in clam chowder and maintaining healthy stocks of these bottom-living sea creatures —is of critical interest to the U.S. shellfish industry. To do this requires a sound understanding of the ocean quahog life cycle. However, how long these clams live and how fast they reproduce is somewhat mysterious because telling the age of an <em>Arctica</em> cannot be done just by looking at it and details about its reproduction are unclear. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      To get these answers, members of the shellfish industry asked the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/science-center-for-marine-fisheries">Science Center for Marine Fisheries (SCeMFiS)</a>—an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center funded by the National Science Foundation—to help uncover the unknowns in quahog life cycles. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      One of the goals of this IUCRC is to help clam fisheries avoid overfishing while keeping their yearly quotas robust. Harvesting <em>Arctica</em> is a $34-million a year industry and requires consideration of environmental, economic, and ecological concerns. Researchers at SCEMFIS developed a way to use imaging and software technology to uncover how quickly these clams reproduce and grow large enough to replace quahogs that are harvested from the seabed.

    <h3>How Old is a Quahog?</h3>
  
    <p>
      The <em>Arctica</em> clam is long-lived. In U.S. waters, using techniques developed by SCeMFiS, the oldest ocean quahog was found to be around 240 years old, says Eric Powell, director of SCEMFIS. To put that in perspective, he adds, “that animal was born before the Revolutionary War.” 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Only large <em>Arctica</em> are harvested. Most clams of that size are at least 60 years old, but many can be much older. The distribution of ages in the population is important because a sustainable fishery depends upon consistent recruitment (i.e., reproduction and growth) balancing the numbers removed by the fishery. For a long-lived species, understanding recruitment is critical because rebuilding an overfished stock can require a long period of time. Knowing the distribution of ages in the population reveals these all-important recruitment dynamics.

      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <p>
      As <em>Arctica</em> grows, the clam produces a ring of shell each year. Similar to the way a tree grows tree rings. As in a tree, the number of layers in a quahog shell equals the age of the clam. Counting quahog rings isn’t a new idea, and there was already a technique for aging each clam. The problem was it was tedious and slow. “A good technician might be able to do one [clam] a day,” said Powell. But to fully understand the range of ages and growth rates at a fishing site, a team needs to collect and count 700 to 1,000 quahogs. Aging that many animals could take years! 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      To speed up the process, SCEMFIS researchers used a new method to age each quahog. They first took high-resolution photographs of the cut shells, tiling the images together. The images are highly detailed, spanning 20,000 by 8,000 pixels, which clearly highlight the growth lines of the <em>Arctica</em>. Each image is then run through a software program that allows technicians to annotate and measure the growth history of the clams. 
    </p>
  
    <p>
      “We've made a big step forward in coming up with a method that's much more efficient at allowing us to age a large number of animals, which is absolutely critical to answer the fishery’s questions of how much harvesting can be done while maintaining a sustainable stock,” says Powell.

    <h3>Growth in Mid-Atlantic Quahogs</h3>
  
    <p>
      Although their research is ongoing, the SCEMFIS team has made some important discoveries in mid-Atlantic <em>Arctica</em> clams. Powell says one of the first thing they discovered is that the growth rates are speeding up over time.

      In recent decades, insects have become more resistant to pesticides. As resistance becomes more widespread, the agricultural biotechnology sector has sought viable alternatives to curtail the huge economic losses associated with insect pests. One of these alternative approaches, called RNA interference (RNAi), could be used to kill pests by silencing genes that are critical for their survival.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      RNAi (a 2006 Nobel Prize-winning discovery), which functions across a wide range of plants and animals, is a useful laboratory tool for the study of gene function. In addition to application for commercial pest control in agriculture, RNAi-based technologies are also being pursued for use in animal and human healthcare.
    </p>
  
    <figure>
      <img alt="biosensor" src="site.baseurl/visuals/achievements/bugs.jpg">
      <figcaption>
        RNAi is a powerful tool for protecting agricultural crops from pest damage. It functions by preventing the production of proteins that are essential for pest survival. CAMTech researchers have discovered why RNAi works well in coleopteran insects, such as the beetle on the left, but not in lepidopteran insects, such as the fall armyworm on the right.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
  
    <p>
      RNAi can be initiated by feeding double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to the target insect pest. These dsRNA are cut within cells into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by Dicer enzymes. The siRNAs, carried by a protein complex, scan for other RNAs with a complementary sequence. These target sequences are bound by the siRNA and subsequently cleaved, thereby preventing the production of proteins essential for survival of the insect pest.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      RNAi has been successfully applied for management of corn-feeding beetles by expressing dsRNA in the corn plant. Although RNAi works well against beetles (order Coleoptera), it does not work well against other groups of insects, including moths (order Lepidoptera), which cause considerable damage to a wide range of crops. The reasons underlying the limited utility of RNAi for lepidopteran pest management were unclear until recently.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Univ. of Kentucky scientists affiliated with the <a href="site.baseurl/centers/center-for-arthropod-management-technologies">Center for Arthropod Management Technologies (CAMTech)</a>, an Industry-University Cooperative Research Center funded by the National Science Foundation, conducted research to address the differential efficiency of RNAi.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In order to trigger RNAi, dsRNAs must withstand degradation by nuclease enzymes (dsRNases), be absorbed into the cell, and be transported via endosomes (membrane-bound compartments) within the cell to appropriate sites for processing into siRNA. Previous research had suggested that poor uptake of dsRNA played a primary role in the differential efficiency of RNAi against insect pests. CAMTech scientists led by Subba Reddy Palli performed a comparative analysis of dsRNA degradation, uptake, and processing in the Colorado potato beetle (CPB; Coleoptera), in which RNAi works very well, and in the fall armyworm (FAW; Lepidoptera), in which RNAi does not work well.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      In addition to identifying the key proteins involved in RNAi, the team demonstrated that the primary reason for differences in the efficiency of RNAi among insects is likely due to the disappearance of dsRNA into endosomes rather than from limited dsRNA uptake. The dsRNA taken up by CPB cells was processed into siRNA, which silenced target genes. In contrast, the dsRNA taken up by FAW cells were observed to accumulate in endosomes, and not form siRNA that would otherwise silence the genes critical to insect survival. This discovery can now be used to improve RNAi efficiency in major insect pests and disease vectors for which RNAi does not work well.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Along with the potential for endosomal entrapment, the successful delivery of dsRNA to insect cells faces other challenges, including digestion of dsRNA by dsRNases. CAMTech scientists at Univ. of Kentucky and Iowa State Univ. are employing nanotechnology to address these problems. dsRNA that is conjugated to nanoparticles is protected from dsRNases and is taken up by cells more efficiently.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      The researchers used porous silica nanoparticles to deliver dsRNA to insects. In addition, they are performing studies on polyanhydrite nanoparticles to determine how particle size, type, and exposure route affect uptake of nanoparticles in insects such as mosquitoes and cockroaches. The results of these studies will facilitate industrially attractive solutions to the pressing problem of pesticide resistance, which will allow for the development of dsRNA-nanoparticle formulations for improved RNAi-mediated control of insect pests and disease vectors.
