    field_awardtitle:  'Phase II IUCRC at Kansas State University:  Center for Wheat Genetic Resources (WGRC)'
    field_awardamount: 454387
    field_awarddate: 07/12/2018
    field_awardabstractText: 'Wheat is immensely valued as a staple crop and commodity throughout the world, accounting for over 20% of all protein and calories worldwide while contributing an estimated $30 billion boost to the US economy.  Wheat production faces the combined challenges of increasingly variable and unfavorable climates, including new disease and insect pest pressures.  In this context, new climate resilient varieties with a broadened genetic base must be developed.  As a raw ingredient to the success of new wheat varieties, novel genetic diversity from wild relatives is needed to improve performance and resilience to stress.  The Wheat Genetics Resource Center (WGRC) Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) at Kansas State University has the primary focus of effectively and efficiently mining these genetic resources and accelerating delivery of improved diverse germplasm to industry partners with cross-cutting training of the next generation of wheat industry scientists.  The delivery of novel genetic resources and high-caliber scientists to industry partners is the ground work for future advancements and success in the wheat industry.  The resulting improvement of yield potential and nutritional quality in wheat contributes toward resilience of the agriculture sector and the accessibility of affordable and nutritious wheat-based foods to society.The complex wheat genome, more than five times larger than the human genome, and the narrow genetic base of bread wheat, present formable challenges in breeding and to address problems facing the wheat industry.  Managing wheat genetic diversity to improve crop performance and training of new scientists are major functions of the WGRC IUCRC-and are critical success factors for the wheat research enterprise.  The center is advancing full genetic characterization and curation of thousands of accessions of wheat wild relatives across all genomes and ploidy levels while leveraging this information to develop improved germplasm for delivery to industry partners.  With targeted understanding of the genetic diversity, accessing and delivering novel alleles in improved germplasm through allele mining can be greatly expedited.  Technical innovations for efficiently accessing and transferring genes and chromosomes from wild relatives will allow rapid transfer of useful traits to elite germplasm through targeted chromosome engineering, increased recombination, marker assisted breeding and genomic prediction.  Through collaborative industry testing networks, the center delivers improved germplasm including chromosome introgression stocks and diverse populations with 1) abiotic stress tolerance, 2) resistance to disease and insects, 3) yield potential and stability and 4) end-use nutrition and grain quality.This award reflects NSF''s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation''s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.'

    field_awarddate: 07/08/2015
    field_awardabstractText: This project supports the second Phase (five years) of the Water Equipment and Policy I/UCRC (WEP) headquartered in Southeastern Wisconsin, which is home to more than 150 local and international companies serving the water industry.  Co-located at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (Lead institution) and Marquette University, the WEP research center serves as a catalyst for synergizing regional and global assets to create the next generation of products and processes to advance the water industry.  WEP research focuses on creating new sensors and devices, novel materials, innovative water treatment systems, and water policies that will help change the way the world manages its acutely stressed water resources.  The new sensing technologies will address major drawbacks of the existing water contaminant detection methods to provide early warning of water contamination and avoid catastrophes.  New materials and processes are proposed for water conveyance systems which could reduce energy and water loss due to corrosion and leakage from water pipes. Projects focusing on water treatment systems will lead to new water filtration and reuse technologies through efficient and low-cost removal of contaminants.  The water policy-related projects will develop policy components to assess risks, promote benefits, and identify opportunities to advance water technology.  The envisioned projects will benefit potential and current WEP I/UCRC industry companies by enabling new or additional capabilities for their water equipment to increase product performance, market share, profits, and job creation.  The proposed program aims to train the current and future workforce at the frontier of water equipment and policy.  The proposed education plan also features proactive efforts to improve entrepreneurial engineering education; to attract underrepresented students, including women and minorities, into Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields; to integrate research and education; and to broadly disseminate water research and educational findings.Envisioned WEP projects can potentially lead to game-changing water technologies and policies to safeguard our water quality with sustainable approaches.  WEP PIs will carry out research to advance water technologies in real-time sensors for detection of water contaminants, self-cleaning and self-healing materials that can reduce energy consumption and water leakage in water equipment and distribution systems, innovative water treatment systems that can address emerging contaminants while reducing energy and cost, and water policy that can inform policy makers.  A portfolio of real-time sensing technologies has been proposed which includes optical fiber technology, single live cell technology, electrochemical technology, acoustic wave technology, and field-effect transistor technology.  Novel surface microstructures and high-performance superhydrophobic concrete and coatings are proposed to minimize maintenance cost and pumping energy for water components.  Self-healing and wear-resistant coatings are proposed to reduce water leakage.  Novel photocatalytic nanomaterials are proposed for water treatment.  Several technologies are proposed to address emerging contaminants such as pathogens and micropollutants and an advanced, rapid wet-weather treatment process is proposed to safely treat stormwater.  A localized model will be developed to predict nutrient transport in Lake Michigan and inform decision making to minimize algal blooms, beach closures, and clogging of water intakes.  Research also will be carried out to identify and analyze policy obstacles and opportunities to develop, commercialize, and expand emerging water technologies and intensive urban aquaculture projects.

    field_awardabstractText: This project supports the second Phase (five years) of the Water Equipment and Policy I/UCRC (WEP) headquartered in Southeastern Wisconsin, which is home to more than 150 local and international companies serving the water industry.  Co-located at University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (Lead institution) and Marquette University, the WEP research center serves as a catalyst for synergizing regional and global assets to create the next generation of products and processes to advance the water industry.  WEP research focuses on creating new sensors and devices, novel materials, innovative water treatment systems, and water policies that will help change the way the world manages its acutely stressed water resources.  The new sensing technologies will address major drawbacks of the existing water contaminant detection methods to provide early warning of water contamination and avoid catastrophes.  New materials and processes are proposed for water conveyance systems which could reduce energy and water loss due to corrosion and leakage from water pipes. Projects focusing on water treatment systems will lead to new water filtration and reuse technologies through efficient and low-cost removal of contaminants.  The water policy-related projects will develop policy components to assess risks, promote benefits, and identify opportunities to advance water technology.  The envisioned projects will benefit potential and current WEP I/UCRC industry companies by enabling new or additional capabilities for their water equipment to increase product performance, market share, profits, and job creation.  The proposed program aims to train the current and future workforce at the frontier of water equipment and policy.  The proposed education plan also features proactive efforts to improve entrepreneurial engineering education; to attract underrepresented students, including women and minorities, into Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics fields; to integrate research and education; and to broadly disseminate water research and educational findings.Envisioned WEP projects can potentially lead to game-changing water technologies and policies to safeguard our water quality with sustainable approaches.  WEP PIs will carry out research to advance water technologies in real-time sensors for detection of water contaminants, self-cleaning and self-healing materials that can reduce energy consumption and water leakage in water equipment and distribution systems, innovative water treatment systems that can address emerging contaminants while reducing energy and cost, and water policy that can inform policy makers.  A portfolio of real-time sensing technologies has been proposed which includes optical fiber technology, single live cell technology, electrochemical technology, acoustic wave technology, and field-effect transistor technology.  Novel surface microstructures and high-performance superhydrophobic concrete and coatings are proposed to minimize maintenance cost and pumping energy for water components.  Self-healing and wear-resistant coatings are proposed to reduce water leakage.  Novel photocatalytic nanomaterials are proposed for water treatment.  Several technologies are proposed to address emerging contaminants such as pathogens and micropollutants and an advanced, rapid wet-weather treatment process is proposed to safely treat stormwater.  A localized model will be developed to predict nutrient transport in Lake Michigan and inform decision making to minimize algal blooms, beach closures, and clogging of water intakes.  Research also will be carried out to identify and analyze policy obstacles and opportunities to develop, commercialize, and expand emerging water technologies and intensive urban aquaculture projects.

    field_awardabstractText: I/UCRC for Sustainably Integrated Buildings and Sites (SIBS) 1161031 University of North Carolina at Charlotte; Robert Cox 1161017 Carnegie Mellon University; Volker Hartkopf 1160872 CUNY City College; Robert Paaswell The Center for Sustainably Integrated Buildings and Sites (SIBS) would bring together a disparate set of stakeholders (i.e. building owners and operators, component manufacturers, designers, utility providers, etc.) to develop a research agenda focused on the interaction between buildings and their environment. This is an interaction that involves several resource flows (i.e. energy, water, materials, and air) and occurs at scales that affect individual buildings and the community at large. Carnegie Mellon University and the CUNY City College are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) as the lead institution. The primary goal of this planning project is to initiate formal partnership with various industry partners and government/non-governmental agencies that have an interest in creating a more sustainable built environment. The research themes at the proposed IUCRC are aimed at the industry need to respond to regulatory and public demands for minimizing virgin material use, water use, non-renewable energy use, and waste generation, and also at the societal need to protect the natural systems that support human life. The proposed Center will be multi-disciplinary in nature and independent of any one department, school or college. SIBS plans to leverage opportunities and funding from technology commercialization offices and business incubators in North Carolina, New York, and Pennsylvania. The Broader Impact includes the enhancement of R&D and technology transfer infrastructure for the buildings industry, student training (including minority students) in an area that is likely to grow over the next several decades, and workforce training through an annual education and outreach programs for member company employees. Additionally, long term economic impact is expected through potential spin-off companies and increased revenue for existing companies. The proposed center has a broad and deep education and outreach program that includes graduate and undergraduate researchers on all projects. In addition, the PIs intend to use various mechanisms to disseminate SIBS research results to practitioners and students.

    field_awarddate: 09/05/2018
    field_awardabstractText: 'Microelectronics and integrated circuits have revolutionized computing, communication, and information technology. However, in a variety of applications, size, cost, performance, and battery life are increasingly limited by systems that process power and energy. The Center for Power Management Integration (PMIC) will engage with industry partners and conduct targeted research in efficient, high-density power electronics, passive components, and integration strategies. The overall goal of the center is to address bottlenecks related to power and energy management that affect a variety of sectors from performance and mobile computing, to renewable energy, automotive, and industrial electronics. Across these industries, the center will work to help alleviate key performance, packaging, and cost limitations, and enable continued improvements with resulting economic benefits. The center will connect leading academic researchers with a large and growing industry base that has a great need for collaborative, interdisciplinary research as well as workforce development. Educational programs at the graduate and undergraduate levels will address this need while K-12 outreach will help expand awareness of power and energy management disciplines. The program will emphasize recruiting and training engineers from underrepresented backgrounds, building on Dartmouth''s success in recruiting and retaining women in engineering.Unlike traditional analog and digital circuits that have dramatically benefited from semiconductor scaling, power management systems depend on passive components and circuit architectures subject to Maxwell''s equations, material properties, and practical implementation. Thus, addressing bottlenecks in power management requires multidisciplinary innovation in electronics and circuit architectures, passive and active devices, and integration strategies. The PMIC Center will target a range of innovations that leverage novel materials and passive component implementation, new circuit architectures that maximize utilization of available energy- and power-density, and integration strategies leveraging semiconductor foundries and advanced manufacturing. Modeling, design and fabrication of passive components will be advanced through research including optimization of power density and efficiency using advanced models, on-silicon microfabricated inductors using nanocomposite materials and integrated resonant passive components. Research on power electronic circuits will focus on novel architectures that maximize utilization of both active devices and passive components, facilitating a roadmap to mm-scale or monolithic integration. Application-specific objectives relevant to industry partners will also be considered such as reliability, robustness, and performance in high temperature, harsh environments.This award reflects NSF''s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation''s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'The Science Center for Marine Fisheries (SCeMFiS) uses academic and commercial finfish and shellfish fisheries resources to address scientific problems limiting sustainable fisheries. SCeMFiS reflects both a continuing expansion of industry-supported research in an era of increased science rigor in management, and the importance of synergistic collaboration between academics, industry, and regulatory agencies in complex management decisions. Phase II will focus research efforts on: (1) precautionary management that maintains quotas below sustainable levels, thereby limiting economic value and jobs, (2) the influence of climate change on sustainable management and long-range planning, (3) resolution of multiple use conflicts (both spatial and over multi-decadal time frames) between fisheries and energy production, and (4) ecosystem management with a focus on forage fish and ecosystem trophic structure. SCeMFiS will develop essential biological data on fish stocks; improve models of sampling design, population dynamics, and fishery performance; evaluate trends in stock structure and their relation to genetics, physiology and sexual dimorphism; and improve approaches to fishing to reduce discards through gear innovation and modifications in fleet deployment. SCeMFiS offers the convergence of capabilities from a range of oceanographic and marine biological disciplines that is essential to meet the challenges faced by fisheries management. A multi-decadal evolution in fisheries management has formalized the criteria for sustainability and developed numerical models to achieve this goal; but success is limited by insufficient information on fish and shellfish stocks and insufficient development of numerical applications to meet challenges posed by rapid climate change that continues to expose the limitations of present-day data resources and assessment, exacerbating the gap between data availability and data resource needs. SCeMFiS'' capabilities encompass the range of oceanographic, fisheries, and marine biological disciplines essential for addressing the data resource and analytical challenges faced by modern-day fisheries. SCeMFiS fosters basic and applied research in the community dynamics, ecology, and environment of the continental shelf. Examples include obtaining the first age-frequency distributions for the US ocean quahog stock, the oldest living non-colonial animals, the first benthic survey east of Nantucket to identify a range shift in surfclams produced by climate change, a software package for evaluation of the adequacy of survey sampling design, and basic biological data on forage fish such as menhaden. These examples show the nexus between applied research directed at basic questions of fishery management and basic research directed at understanding the pelagic, demersal, and benthic realms of the continental shelf.This award reflects NSF''s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation''s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.'

SCeMFiS provides a mechanism by which a diverse group of fishing companies and organizations can develop a coherent, problem-solving research plan advantaged by access to a wealth of academic resources. Phase 2 will continue to build on this effort. SCeMFiS partners gain ownership of the products developed, and become full partners in assessment and regulatory actions supporting sustainable management. SCeMFiS provides a mechanism by which industry can publicly demonstrate their support for the goal of sustainable seafood. In Phase 2 we will expand efforts to leverage additional research support emphasizing the integrated efforts of the two sites to achieve industry-wide research goals, stabilize precautionary management actions that would otherwise drive quota reductions, reflect management actions that are responsive to climate change driven variations in fish production and accessibility, with all actions in compliance with federal mandates under the Magnuson Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. These goals will be achieved in an environment that promotes graduate education, enables rapid response to emerging data needs, and  provides a combined fishery and economics approach to address societal needs.This award reflects NSF''s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation''s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'Energy sustainability represents one of the grand challenges facing modern society, and solar power provides an important source of renewable energy. Photovoltaics (PV), or solar cells, are solid-state semiconductor-based devices that converts sunlight directly to electricity and do not generate pollution, emissions, or greenhouse gases during operation.  The IUCRC for Next Generation Photovoltaics (NGPV or the Center) is one of the world''s leading PV research consortia.  The NGPV promotes science and advances prosperity and welfare through the Center''s successful, ongoing research and education programs. These programs are focused on bringing down PV system cost, increasing PV system efficiency, and enabling widespread the use of PV electricity. The Center''s research vision is to make PV electricity a major source of energy. There are currently three research sites in the Center: Colorado State University (CSU), The University of Texas at Austin (UT Austin), and Texas A&M University (TAMU).The CSU site of NGPV is focused on reducing the cost of solar energy through advancing thin film PV device performance, performing state-of-the-art materials characterization, streamlining manufacturing and improving module reliability.  The PV-training approach at CSU is strongly team based: students from different disciplines including a significant number of women and veterans work closely with each other, with engineers from industry, and in many cases with students at other universities. Three key PV technologies, developed at CSU, have been translated to industry.  A key goal of the CSU site is to continue to advance the state of the art by developing more sophisticated CdTe based device structures with higher efficiencies and improved understanding through advanced materials and electronic characterization.  Recently, the CSU site demonstrated device efficiency of 19.2%, the highest efficiency demonstrated for polycrystalline CdTe materials by any academic or national laboratory worldwide. These advances have been demonstrated on pilot scale systems with a direct line of sight to industrial manufacturing. A key research thrust is to demonstrate still higher cell efficiencies, with 25% being a realistic near-term (3 year) goal and 30% the longer term goal. The unique co-sublimation technology developed at CSU will be utilized for the fabrication of the advanced device structures. In addition to improving device efficiencies, research focus at CSU has progressed to improve module efficiency, improve reliability and facilitate deployment. The efforts will lead to lower LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) and help facilitate the goal of 2-3 cents/kWhr. Overall, center has the potential to further increase the impact of the multi-billion-dollar U.S. PV industry that is growing rapidly and greatly expand the application of solar electricity.This award reflects NSF''s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation''s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'Phase II I/UCRC Texas A&M Engineering Experiment Station Site: Center for Next Generation Photovoltaics Texas A&M University (TAMU) joins the existing NSF I/UCRC Next Generation Photovoltaic Center (Center) which presently operates as a Phase II Center with research sites at the University of Texas-Austin (UTA) and Colorado State University (CSU). Energy security and sustainability is one of the grand challenges facing modern societies. The long-term vision of this research center it to bring together the science, engineering, education, policy advances to enable widespread adoption of solar energy. While the cost of the photovoltaic (PV) "solar cell" has dropped significantly, there are numerous challenges that remain that must be addressed before electricity generated directly from the sun can become a cost-competitive with traditional sources. The addition of Texas A&M University enables the center to address the balance-of-system (BOS) issues that lie at that interface of solar cells into the electrical grid. The TAMU site will specialize in the end-to-end continuous spectrum of PV BOS technologies that are not a current focus of the Center. There are also numerous non-technical issues that create challenges for the PV industry. These so-called ?soft-cost? of the balance-of-system will also be part of the TAMU Site research agenda. The scope of the TAMU ? BOS Site (Site) will enable the Center to assess the entire solar industry, bringing value to all stake-holders from OEM equipment manufacturers, through systems integration, to end-customers and consumers. Because of this wide scope, the Site will be positioned to impact the industry through a scientifically-based, data driven research, design, and development process that is not currently available to individual BOS organizations. The TAMU Site will concentrate on research that assesses predictors of technology outcomes and global imprint of solar energy, along with solar costs, as indicated through technology teams, funding sources, collection technologies, as well as enhancing Center research on PV and additional conversion solar variables.'

    field_awardabstractText: Many important components and systems that are fabricated by industry and subsequently used within the US infrastructure require joining at some point within the manufacturing process. Examples include aircraft parts, bridges, and power generation plants, just to name a few. Joining processes are quite complex and can significantly alter the properties of the materials used to create the component, thus affecting the ability of the component to operate safely over the targeted design life. Safe and effective design, fabrication, and use of components manufactured by joining requires integration of many engineering disciplines. Unfortunately, there is currently only a handful of US universities for solving these challenges, and there is a shortage of qualified engineers being trained in the US to address these issues. The Manufacturing and Materials Joining Innovation Center (Ma2JIC) was established to fulfill these needs. Due to the similarities between joining and many emerging Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes, the Center has expanded to include AM. The academic researchers at all the Ma2JIC sites work closely with Center members to identify research projects that will provide member companies with methods for improving the performance and/or reducing the costs associated with components they design, manufacture, and/or use. The research projects conducted at all the sites also serve as vehicles for educating the next generation of highly trained graduate-level scientist and engineers in order to address the shortage of such professionals faced by industry. The Lehigh University site within Ma2JIC provides research expertise in several distinct areas such as modeling and electron microscopy, and also provides a strong link to the energy industry through their Energy Research Center. In addition, the educational goal is extended at the Lehigh site to include undergraduate students through a senior capstone course on Materials Selection and Failure Analysis in which Center members provide failed components for analysis by the students and serve as industrial mentors to the students.

    field_awardabstractText: 'A number of energy-related industrial activities as well as a range of natural disasters - such as earthquakes and landslides - involve the deformation and eventual failure of geomaterials in presence of fluids.  The governing mechanisms remain poorly understood. The Industry-University Collaborative Research Center for Geomechanics and Mitigation of Geohazards (GMG) will enable a synergetic research effort to improve their understanding.  GMG will thereby contribute to more efficient, reliable and safe methods for energy production, CO2 and gas storage and improved methods for the assessment and mitigation of earthquake and landslide hazard. The center members include oil and gas companies, engineering companies in the areas of geomechanics and geohazard mitigation, and utilities operators concerned with the exposure of infrastructures to earthquake and landslide hazard. Participation of postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students in the research projects based on fundamental science yet relevant to the industrial and societal needs to be pursued by the center will educate a new generation of academic and industrial leaders in science and engineering.Deformation in the subsurface is often associated to, and eventually coupled with fluid flow. Investigating these mechanisms is important to improve our ability to model the effects of fluid injection or extraction in the sub-surface, fault dynamics in general, landslides and the ground response to earthquake shaking. The Industry-University Collaborative Research Center for Geomechanics and Mitigation of Geohazards (GMG) will therefore conduct cross-disciplinary research to advance the fundamental understanding of how geomaterials deform and fail in presence of fluids. GMG will achieve its goal by combining experimental and modeling studies, and leveraging cutting-edge research in geomechanics and computational mechanics, remote sensing, and geophysics. The research will benefit industrial activities involving the management of fluids in the sub-surface related for example, to energy production, gas storage and CO2 storage, and will advance methods for the assessment and mitigation of geohazards, whether of natural origin or related to industrial activities.This award reflects NSF''s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation''s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'Data centers are an integral part of life, providing services ranging from social networking, e-commerce and entertainment to cloud infrastructures that provide storage and computing capabilities for individuals and enterprises. Data centers consume over 2% of the nation''s electricity, generated mostly from fossil sources. The Center for Energy-Smart Electronic systems (ES2) was established to develop tools and methodologies for improving the energy efficiency of electronic systems, primarily data centers. Much of the energy expended by data centers is wasted due to operating inefficiencies, including operating more servers than are needed to handle the workload and overcooling the IT equipment, or deploying sub-optimal cooling and IT technologies. ES2?s research focusses on developing intelligent and fully automated techniques for operating data centers to match the IT and cooling resources to the workload demands, avoiding energy waste while maintaining service quality. ES2 research benefits society by: (a) providing solutions to reduce the demand on the electrical grid and the carbon footprint and enabling the growth of data center-based services in an energy-efficient way and (b) developing human resources by training engineers and computer scientists in high-demand skills. ES2?s research therefore enables the nation to maintain competitive, agile and energy-efficient cyber services and infrastructures. The goal of ES2 is to dramatically reduce data center energy consumption. The Phase I funding from NSF supported the development of models, metrics and infrastructures that would realize this vision. At University of Texas, Arlington (UTA), Phase II research focuses on improving energy efficiency at various scales of a data center facility and addressing the challenges involved in implementing alternative data center cooling technologies such as evaporative cooling and dielectric oil immersion cooling. UTA utilizes purpose-built data center research facilities and numerical analysis tools to evaluate and optimize the various cooling systems. At chip level, a dynamic water cooled cold plate developed in Phase I will be scaled to a chip scale package and integrated with robust flow control devices to enable uniform temperature distribution and realize reduction in pumping power.  At the rack and room level, Phase II research focuses on developing deeper understanding in implementing evaporative cooling systems and address the corresponding particulate and gaseous contamination in data centers. Also, Phase II studies will focus on evaluating cooling performance, reliability and operability of systems implementing direct-to-chip liquid cooling and oil immersion cooling. In Phase I, UTA has graduated ten ES2-funded PhD students and over 60 students with master''s degrees.'

The center''s vision is the creation and operation of energy-optimized data centers and electronic systems at any specified performance level by smart allocation and distribution of IT load, smart integration of controlled on-demand cooling, and smart elimination of energy waste and inefficiencies. The Phase I funding from NSF supported the development of models, metrics and infrastructures that would realize this vision. At Binghamton University, Phase II research focuses on the challenges involved in reducing energy waste with just-in-time, just enough server and cooling capacities to handle the instantaneous workload while meeting the performance, reliability and availability goals. The approach taken relies on the use of sophisticated techniques to model and predict the workload and cooling system needs sufficiently in advance to permit timely adjustments of processing and cooling resources.  Considerations of thermal lags and other transient thermal phenomena, the time taken for server activations and deactivations and the potential impact of failures in a tightly-provisioned system come into play, making the solution a complex optimization problem.  Inherent inefficiencies within the cooling, IT and power delivery components are addressed through investigations centered on new and emerging technologies.'

Advanced strategies for cooling data centers using hybrid air-liquid cooling and single and two-phase liquid cooling are being developed and optimized.  These advanced cooling methods anticipate ever increasing thermal densities in data center equipment. Our research is leading to the development of improved methods and metrics for utilizing Dynamic Hybrid Cooling Systems which can be used to deliver efficient on-demand cooling where and when it is needed.  The Villanova site is investigating methods for the conversion of Waste Heat from electrical power consumed in a data center to useful Energy.  More than 90% of electrical power supplied to a data center is dissipated as waste heat, hence our research will have significant impact on the overall energy sustainability of data center systems.'

The inability to answer these questions, or even properly phrase the questions, impacts not only the development of sensors themselves, but also the development of data exploitation algorithms. Further, these unanswered questions are critical for eventually providing human users the ability to understanding the reliability of sensor performance under new and changing operating conditions. Specifically, sensors are developed under an assumed mode of use, and the exploitation algorithms are then left to extract whatever information the resultant sensor may afford, without that prior development having been properly informed by a realistic performance model. Moreover, the exploitation algorithms themselves are developed under presumed statistical models that may have varying degrees of agreement with actual sensor phenomenology, and these algorithms are then trained (e.g., to set operating parameters) based on a representative set of training measurements. However, the sensor community lacks any means to propagate mismatch between statistical assumptions and sensor phenomenology, or mismatch between training data and operational data, into the sensor algorithm or to even reliably predict a sensor''s ultimate performance.

    field_awardabstractText: 'The Center for Research in Storage Systems (CRSS) conducts research to improve the performance, security, reliability, efficiency, and usability of data storage.  A system composed of thousands or even millions of storage devices must provide these characteristics, though individual devices may lack them.  Finding and using data in such large, complex systems is challenging, yet it must be made simple and efficient for end users.  Complex systems are also subject both to hardware and software failures as well as directed attacks to steal or destroy data, so storage systems must guard against both security breaches and data loss.CRSS is concerned with adapting systems to better utilize new storage technologies such as byte-addressable non-volatile memory (BNVM), shingled disk, and glass.  Operating systems and file systems must adapt to these new technologies to provide higher performance and better usability for BNVM, and improved security, efficiency, and long-term reliability for archival storage.  Cross-cutting issues such as improved security and the usage of machine learning to optimize storage systems are relevant for all types of storage systems, yet there remain many open questions in how to address these issues, particularly given the large scale in both time and size that CRSS is exploring.  Improving storage systems for large-scale data science is also a significant challenge that CRSS is addressing.Data storage is the foundation of our digital society: the vast majority of our knowledge and information is stored digitally.  The research done at CRSS will allow society as a whole to better keep and utilize the flood of information our world is gathering. CRSS research will help cloud providers provide more reliable and usable large-scale storage, and will help reduce the risk of security breaches. CRSS research will also help organizations store and access the massive amounts of data generated by the Internet of Things, further aiding a wide range of societal issues such as climate, transportation, and housing.CRSS will maintain a Web-accessible project repository at https://www.crss.ucsc.edu/repository.html, which will have links to publications, data, and code developed by all CRSS sites.  Code will be hosted on either gitlab.soe.ucsc.edu or bitbucket.org.

    field_awardabstractText: 'Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) or "drones" have captured our attention as a means to collect aerial sensor data, carry small payloads, and motivate students through low-cost, hands-on flight experiences. Numerous research challenges related to safely operating UAS of all sizes and missions must be addressed before we can realize their full potential. The Center for UAS (C-UAS) is an existing National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) supporting a wide range of UAS-centric research topics. C-UAS, led by Brigham-Young University, has successfully transitioned into Phase II. The C-UAS I/UCRC provides a critical pathway for university and industry members to collaboratively identify and explore important basic and applied research relevant to UAS. The University of Michigan proposes to join the C-UAS team, offering new industry members and new research expertise to the existing center. The Michigan team complements existing C-UAS strengths in autonomy, guidance, navigation, and control and offers new expertise in high altitude long endurance platforms, reduced-order aerodynamics modeling, and energy harvesting.C-UAS is pursuing two new center-wide focus areas to kick off Phase II: autonomy and counter-UAS. For autonomy, Michigan researchers will pursue identification and infusion of new data sources to enable future UAS flight planners to quantitatively model and minimize risk to people and property on the ground. Michigan will also extend previous work in static and dynamic geofencing to assure each UAS remains within airspace it is authorized to occupy. For counter-UAS, Michigan will pursue fundamental research to analyze and design defense strategies against aerial swarms through development of information-sharing and motion models that can be used to compute jamming and interception defensive actions. The Michigan team will also investigate two new UAS research thrusts. High-altitude long-endurance (HALE) flight is envisioned through a flexible-wing platform that offers light-weight aerodynamically-efficient performance; the proposed research will develop a validated model of aeroelastic effects coupled with flight dynamics for very-flexible UAS with modeling, simulation, and UAS flight experiments. A second new research effort will develop reduced-order models of the atmospheric boundary layer and vehicle aeromechanics effects that account for day/night convection in complex terrain and urban corridors with application to UAS flight planning, trajectory prediction, and control.'

    field_awardabstractText: "The biopharmaceutical industry represents one of the most technically demanding, high impact industries in the United States and worldwide, and is a driver of scientific innovation and economic prosperity.  One of the fastest growing, and most promising type of new drug candidates, are those based on proteins as the active ingredient.  However, there are a number of long-standing, industry-wide challenges that occur during the development and manufacturing of such ?pharmaceutical proteins?.  The proposed I/UCRC Site at the University of Delaware (UD) will bring world-class expertise to the existing Center for Pharmaceutical Development (CPD), in technical areas that are central to innovation for the development of pharmaceutical proteins (so-called biopharmaceuticals).  Examples include: more efficient purification processes, better product stability and reduced risk of side effects or unwanted immunogenic responses in patients, and improved control of manufacturing processes.  The proposed, expanded CPD will be the most far-reaching industry-university consortium to date that is focused on pharmaceutical product development, rather than the more traditional focus on ?upstream? research and drug-discovery activities.  The project areas it will address have the potential to greatly improve the efficiency and economics of drug development science and engineering, as well as the fundamental understanding and education of engineers and scientists in the industry.  This can benefit the U.S. broadly in terms of domestic job creation, as well as improved time to market, cost to patients, and reduced risk for investors, based on the development and testing of new therapeutic proteins (sole focus of the UD Site) and innovator pharmaceutical products more generally (focus of CPD overall).  The major technical areas for the biopharmaceutical industry that are the focus on the UD site for the CPD include: (i) commercial and pilot-scale bioreactors to produce recombinant protein for use as a drug; (ii) extensive purification to produce essentially pure therapeutic protein in aqueous solution; (iii) formulation of the purified protein to assure multi-year stability, robust manufacturing, and effective delivery to patients; (iv) analytical technologies and instrumentation to support extremely tight specifications at each of stages (i) to (iii). The faculty in the proposed UD Site for the CPD are world-recognized leaders in areas (i) to (iv), and will provide new strengths to the current CPD that complement the existing expertise in solid-state pharmaceutical stability and delivery, and development of industrial enzymes and related biotechnology products."

The Center for Pharmaceutical Development focuses on increasing the safety and lowering the cost of drugs through research into the formulation and manufacturing of both innovator and generic drugs.  The research interests of the center are threefold.  First, the center is developing new biological catalysts that are used to synthesize drugs in a way that is more efficient and safer for the environment.  Second, the center is improving analysis methods for determining what happens to the drug during the manufacturing process, and how that might lead to product failure.  Finally, the center is focused on large-molecule drugs such as proteins and antibodies, which are emerging as potent new therapies.  The societal benefit of this research would ultimately be cheaper and safer drugs for the patient.Despite huge progress in pharma over the last 50 to 100 years, there are still a lot of unmet needs which cause shortened lifespans and unnecessary suffering by patients. However, the development of novel drugs takes a lot of time (commonly more than 10 years) and money (commonly more than $1-2 billion).  After discovery, the late-stage development begins, with clinical trials, manufacturing studies, especially process development and scale-up, and also with the development of the active ingredient into a drug product, such as a tablet, or an injectable.  Development into a drug product requires solutions for formulation and drug delivery.  The Center for Pharmaceutical Development (CPD) covers late-stage development in the development of new drugs; CPD focuses on manufacturing, formulation, and analytical tools. In the upcoming phase II (2015-2020), the CPD will operate at three sites: Georgia Tech (GT)/Emory in Atlanta, GA, the University of Kentucky (UK), in Lexington, KY, and now also at the University of Delaware in Newark, DE. Georgia Tech/Emory will focus on highly selective and environmentally benign biological catalysts and integration of reaction and separation (with Delaware); the University of Kentucky site will contribute with their unique strength in analyzing and stabilizing solid pharmaceuticals, both small molecules and therapeutic proteins (?biologics?) (with Delaware); and the University of Delaware will add strength in the separation and purification of therapeutic proteins (?biologics?) and in formulation, i.e. in keeping such biologic stable. The challenges above draw in a significant number of women and underrepresented minority students. Of the graduate students supported wholly or in part by the CPD, more than half (53%) were women and 18% were underrepresented minorities.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'The U.S. Government, academia, domestic industry and the public increasingly acknowledge the imperative that we conserve energy and natural resources while exercising judicious stewardship of the environment. The issue of sustainability is and should be paramount in how we design, manufacture, use, and retire the many products consumed within the United States and throughout the world. Unlike solar or wind energy that can be cost effectively harnessed for a long time or agricultural products as a natural resource, inorganic materials, such as metals and minerals, are not renewable. Therefore, the need exists for the development of technologies to address materials recovery and recycling. Although considerable coordinated academic research is rightly underway to meet energy challenges, university efforts to build the basic science and technologies for materials sustainability are less extensive and fragmented despite the prospect for significant energy and environmental ramifications. Research supporting materials recovery and recyclability is inherently multidisciplinary and must respond to the needs of a multiplicity of commercial stakeholders from throughout the supply chain. CR3 brings together four leading universities with expertise in materials science and engineering. The industrial application of new advanced materials will require an increase in the efficiency of materials resource recovery and recycling to achieve a circular economy The advanced manufacturing technologies that are available today do not have a natural route to implementation in industry. CR3 brings together key constituencies in the resource recovery and recycling area to develop comprehensive technology transfer pathways to industry. The primary focus of CR3 is on key sectors of iron and steel, non-ferrous structural metals, light metals, rare-earths, energy materials and photovoltaic metals, high value refractory metals and electronic materials. Technology development addresses the product manufacturing wastes, post-consumer wastes, instrumentation, sensors and controls, design for disassembly and conversion of trash to treasure. There are a number of key industry challenges in the area of resource recovery and recycling: specifically, scarcity of feed stock materials and increasing cost of material resources, increasing amounts of waste from industrial processes as well as end-of-life products, need for solutions for resource recovery, reuse, and recycling of critical materials, need for energetically favorable, environmentally compatible and economically viable industrial processes. These challenges are addressed by CR3 through the development of physical and chemical processes for secondary resource sortation, beneficiation and concentration, as well as value-extraction.

    field_awardabstractText: The University of Minnesota is completing single university Phase I I/UCRC Center on Intelligent Storage (CRIS) and is proposing to establish a multi-university I/UCRC Phase II Center on intelligent storage with Texas A&M University and Temple University. The center research will focus on intelligent storage devices that have greater semantic and structural knowledge about their stored data as compared to standard disk technology. Additionally, center will develop high-performance long-term data management systems that will ensure the necessary levels of security throughout the data?s lifecycle.Currently, there is emphasis on addressing the needs of ?big data? environment and ?cloud computing? such as identifying and locating the right information and managing and preserving the existing data. In order to meet these needs, new storage architectures, different storage systems design, new data models, new information access methods and new ways to deliver information will be identified. The focus of the center will be on how to solve the big data problem with new storage technologies, new designs of storage systems/architectures, emerging management frameworks and tools in the current computing and communication environment. Industry has recognized the importance of this new computing and communication environment. Many new products for storage/file systems, storage management, and ways of preserving the data have evolved. However, most of these applications require more research and development. The center will utilize synergies from both academia and industry, encourage innovative and creative thinking for integrated solutions that combine techniques from storage systems, file systems and information retrieval, enhance the understanding of large scale data management and information retrieval, and develop prototypes for long-term data preservation.The ?big data? problem is currently faced by not only individuals, but also by almost all segments of the society, including professional groups, research communities, companies and government. The proposed center will facilitate the process of developing and researching solutions that can efficiently manage and preserve large volumes of data and provide needed information to an end user on-demand from anywhere at any time. The potential outcomes includes fostering the advancement of science and technology, making the society more efficient and secure, providing better health-care delivery, and better ways of preserving information and arts produced by our culture.

Concrete, steel and timber are the backbones of physical infrastructure. High strength polymer composites have been used for aerospace structures for about five decades and their use in civil infrastructure spans about 20 years. To accelerate the adoption of polymer composites into infrastructure, the NSF I/UCRC Center of the Integration of Composites into Infrastructure (CICI) was established as a joint effort of West Virginia University (WVU), North Carolina State University (NCSU) and the University of Miami. Recently, NSF has awarded a travel grant to establish an additional CICI site at Nanjing University of Technology in China. The NSF I/UCRC program brings together universities, private companies and government agencies together to leverage the research dollars for all parties by engaging in highly cooperative research. CICI''s work with civil infrastructure has a tremendous effect on daily life, thus the Nation as a whole benefits as composite and hybrid materials lead to infrastructure systems of higher safety, shorter construction times and longer life spans at a reduced overall cost and improved labor productivity with the creation of new and higher skilled job opportunities. Member companies and end users benefit from the interaction with others in their field including highly trained students, with over 100 students expected to pass through CICI in the next 5 years. CICI is prolific technology transfer machine, exceeding the output for most I/UCRCs through the publishing of journal articles and conference presentations to promote the scientific research and knowledge dissemination. Broadly speaking, the technical focus of CICI can be broken into four different areas. Initially, fundamental research projects are undertaken to broaden the knowledge base on infrastructure composites. This includes lifecycle performance, aging studies, evaluation of bond strength within a composite and as a substrate, and many others. From this on-going research, products are being developed that can be mass-implemented in infrastructure markets, including innovative hollow core or basalt fiber FRP rebar, waterway products that are noncorrosive or fabric reinforced cementitious composites for masonry wall strengthening and many others. The implementation of these products is the next focus area and is primarily accomplished through the development of codes and specifications. CICI has worked on the ASCE LRFD pultruded GFRP composites code, ASTM specifications, ACI building design and construction codes, the International Code Council and IIFC. Finally, CICI has an evaluation component based on IAB member feedback to ensure the composites that are implemented in the field are performing as designed as a part of our long-term performance program. Thus, through research, development, implementation and evaluation, CICI is involved in all facets of composite product evolution.'

FRP composites and geosythentics are gaining acceptance for infrastructure due to their corrosion resistance, ease of installation, and proof-of-concept from field demonstrations in service for up to four decades. The biggest advantage to composite materials is durability, as they do not corrode or rot allowing for an extended service life thus extending taxpayer dollars.  With the support of NSF, CICI currently consists of a consortium of four universities and 31 industry members, bringing together faculty, students, practitioners, manufacturers, trade organizations and government agencies to overcome the obstacles to widespread deployment of composites, forging lasting partnerships, and educating students, engineers and contractors. CICI focuses on four research thrusts. First, research on material development, manufacturing, and characterization allows for the development of new composite materials and recycling of discarded polymer composites with a clear understanding of the physico-chemical and mechanical properties. Second, the durability and aging of composites is evaluated under accelerated aging and by examining existing structures to ensure that composites can have long service lives under harsh environmental conditions. Third, design, implementation and evaluation of composites in new construction and rehabilitation of existing structures.. Fourth, CICI contributes to the development of standards, specifications, and guide documents required for the deployment of new technologies into commercial practice. The University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) will continue to examine the utilization of composites, including geosynthetics, polymeric materials including geopolymers, and other geocomposites in subsurface infrastructure including pavements, runways, embankments, retaining structures, earth dams and levees. Both life cycle cost analysis and sustainable utilization of composites will be addressed in these studies. The UTA CICI site has a strong research background in soil-structure interactions, and will work with the partner universities on materials, structural retrofits and offshore soil treatment including geosynthetics.This award reflects NSF''s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation''s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'Phase II I/UCRC Pennsylvania State University Site: Center for Health Organization TransformationThe U.S. healthcare system is a global leader in terms of scientific and clinical technology development. However, with expenditures at 17.1% of the GDP, significant gaps in terms of access and quality exist, along with rates of morbidity and mortality that are substantially worse than other industrialized nations. The mission of CHOT is to advance the knowledge and practice of transformational strategies in evidenced-based healthcare management and clinical practice. The development of transformative approaches will necessitate involving partners from all sectors of healthcare including IT providers, systems solutions providers, care providers, insurers, and employers with large healthcare coverage programs. The realization that a "one-size-fits-all" approach to healthcare is unsustainable has motivated the modeling, development and deployment of personalized advanced wellness systems (PAWS). PAWS transcends traditional boundaries existing within healthcare systems, ranging from personalized patient care models (from a patient?s perspective), to personalized drug delivery systems (from a healthcare decision maker''s perspective). CHOT is the only industry-university cooperative research center focused on innovations in healthcare delivery. The Center''s interdisciplinary approach will deliver integrated and broadly applicable solutions and will enhance the education of the next generation of healthcare policy experts, physicians, nurses, and engineers. Undergraduate and graduate students become a part of a high-performing multidisciplinary organization that provides an ecosystem for networking, leadership, and career placement. It is expected that the work of the Center will result in improved health care quality and more effective use of financial and system resources in the health system, while providing immediate decision support to industry. CHOT has identified four research areas in order to meet the needs of our members as well as the healthcare industry: macro-systems innovation; health quality, safety, access, and efficiency; patient-centered care and population health interventions; electronic health records and information exchange. The underlying theme of personalized advanced wellness systems (PAWS) is achieved through fundamental research in value-based care, time-driven activity based costing, person-centered care, medical device design and integration, emergency department benchmarking, community paramedicine, telehealth and wellness, and precision medicine and precision health. A concerted plan of seven research projects will be supported by research methods in systems engineering. In particular, systems thinking and system dynamics methods will be combined with simulation, data analytics, and machine learning in order to develop models that can inform the prospective assessment of interventions and innovations. In order to bridge gap between what is learned/discovered and what is done in practice/ management, knowledge-to-action (KTA) initiatives will be pursued, with a view toward technology readiness in order to increase the impact of these projects.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'The University of Louisville (UL) applies to become a Phase II research site addition for the NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) for Health Organization Transformation (CHOT). The American health care delivery system falls short of care that is safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, and equitable. Health care organizations are continually innovating in both management and clinical practices to address care efficiency shortcomings, offer the latest clinical technologies, and remain competitive. To attain significant progress on all of these fronts requires transformational changes in health organizations that fundamentally alter practices and culture, and lead to better health care. UL CHOT applies and refines a comprehensive transformation framework that will guide, research, and advance organization transformation in health systems, especially hospitals, clinics, and physician groups. With health spending rising exponentially, government, industry, and the public share growing concerns about a range of health care issues related to the organization and payment for health care services. New care models also require a shift in the types of clinicians that staff healthcare organizations. UL CHOT is committed to conducting research to understand what the optimal mix of these new services will be under new value-based ways of providing healthcare for the benefit of a diverse patient population. UL CHOT''s multi-disciplinary research team proposes to join the existing CHOT university sites, adding value through its in-depth integration of expertise in population health management, health information system design, and health systems sciences that will create new synergies that allows the research to be highly relevant, and incorporate best practices and the latest technology. UL CHOT will conduct mixed-methodology, applied research on the antecedents, execution, and effects of transformational interventions and strategies that combine evidence-based management, clinical and information technology innovations, and ongoing organizational learning and cultural change. Transformational efforts in health systems frequently ignore or prematurely treat several individual and organizational elements as "fixed" or immutable. Transformational strategies call for significant reexamination and, often, realignment of values, processes, and structures characterizing a health system. Such major innovations (i.e., LEAN, cutting-edge clinical innovations and information systems) call for leadership, significant cultural change, inter-professional alignment, elements of process reengineering, and effective monitoring and feedback. Our industry-guided research program identifies the factors that produce desired results from these kinds of transformational interventions in health systems. UL CHOT will contribute significantly to the efficiency and quality of care offered by industry partners by enabling more effective implementation of the aforementioned tools and strategies.'

    field_awardabstractText: The University of Washington Departments of Industrial and Systems Engineering and Health Services is a university site member of the Center for Health Organization Transformation (CHOT). The mission of CHOT is to advance the knowledge and practice of transformational strategies in evidence-based management and clinical practice. CHOT conducts cooperative research among universities, health systems and other health-related industries to advance and link system design and technologies in innovative research to advance healthcare. The UW site (CHOT-UW) focuses on research to improve the integration of technology and healthcare delivery; specifically, CHOT-UW works to advance the application of telehealth, system analytics and risk modeling, and healthcare operational innovations. The CHOT-UW research team is multidisciplinary and collaborates across the University. CHOT-UW industry partners represent a collaboration that will impact healthcare delivery throughout the Pacific Northwest as well as nationally. CHOT-UW expands CHOT?s existing research capacity, increases its geographic presence in the West and broadens the technology presence on the IAB. In addition, CHOT-UW provides enhanced educational opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to participate in an applied research program. CHOT and CHOT-UW work together to make technological breakthroughs and advances in the field of healthcare. The University of Washington Departments of Industrial and Systems Engineering and Health Services proposes to join the Center for Health Organization Transformation (CHOT) as a university site (CHOT-UW). CHOT-UW?s the research focus is at the integration of technology and healthcare delivery. As systems engineering principles move past the early-adopter stage in the healthcare sector, the research agenda needs to shift toward a more interdisciplinary approach?one that incorporates both the human and economic factors associated with system redesign, in a way that fully supports the  goals of  (1) improving patient experience of care (including quality and satisfaction); (2) improving population health; and (3) reducing the per capita cost of healthcare. Recent US health care reform efforts attempt to address these systemic issues. However, to further achieve health system improvements, it is important to understand the complex systems that affect access to and coordination of care from an interdisciplinary approach. The core research team from engineering and health services will be supplemented with faculty expertise in informatics and primary-care technology and public health analytics. This team brings a breadth of theoretical as well as applied knowledge and are prepared to deliver implementable research findings that result in efficient, high-quality, patient-centered care while taking a technically-informed approach to inform the development of decision-support, feedback and process re-engineering mechanisms.

    field_awardabstractText: In Phase II operation, the I/UCRC for Health Organization Transformation (CHOT)intends to approach the multifaceted problems of health organizations with prospective, multi-disciplinary, and multi-level research strategies that take advantage of quasi-experimental designs and natural experiments, where feasible. In its five years of Phase I,  CHOT has quickly removed research silos by pairing multi-disciplinary research teams of engineers, strategic management experts, management scientists, and health services researchers with high-impact problems that top-tier health systems struggle to address. Specifically, CHOT has produced research that enables health systems to better identify, apply, optimize, and assess the impact of innovations on access, quality, and efficiency of healthcare services. The organizational transformations identified through these collaborative efforts will continue to be disseminated as best practices where innovations indicate a need for sustained changes.U.S. healthcare expenditures, at 17.9 percent of GDP, account for over twice the healthcare spending per capita of the average of the 34 developed nations of the OECD. Nonetheless, U.S. falls below the OECD averages on many population health conditions. Current and planned CHOT research projects coincide with the most expansive change in healthcare policy in the U.S.   CHOT members benefit by obtaining early validation of the direct impact of the innovations in their own organizations. Center researchers and students work closely with health managers, engineers, and other front-line professionals in health systems being studied. This kind of training, especially for doctoral students, supports the ability of future researchers and teachers to address industry issues from a position of real-world experience. It also engages participating industry professionals in identifying significant problems and understanding existing knowledge bases related to these problems so that they can more effectively implement any needed changes. Aggressive recruiting for graduate students among under-represented groups will continue, increasing the diversity of the workforce for both academia and industry. Exciting new opportunities will continue for undergraduate students in Center research activities, exposing them to health services research and encouraging them to pursue graduate education.

    field_awarddate: 07/18/2016
    field_awardabstractText: "Nearly every research field and industry sector is struggling with managing and extracting useful information from massive data sets, that are commonly referred to as Big Data. Modeling, data management, and analytics are key elements in understanding and using these data sets, and their importance in academia and industry is predicted to grow exponentially. One central challenge can be expressed as follows: Given specific analysis tasks and specific constraints on the available Big Data, how do we enable productive, efficient, and secure end-to-end value extraction from the data? To address this challenge, we propose to join industry members with participating academic centers in a new site of the existing Center for Hybrid Multicore Productivity Research (CHMPR) I/UCRC, at NC State University (NCSU) in Raleigh, NC, with the goal of conducting trans-disciplinary translational science and research of enabling better decision making in presence of Big Data. The fundamental research done at CHMPR/NCSU will be translated into technology developments, delivering practical solutions to hard problems. This translation will apply to federal agencies, government organizations, and industry sectors struggling with hard Big-Data problems, thus contributing to the progress of science and advancing the future Big-Data needs of the industry and society. Success in solving the problem of extracting value from massive data hinges on balancing fundamental research, technological know-how, and commercial market intelligence. We propose both to address recognized aspects of this problem and to develop the science and training that will address future aspects of this problem. The CHMPR/NCSU effort toward end-to-end enablement of data will focus on developing technologies and tools for bridging the time gap between the acquisition of data and real-time and long-term decision making. CHMPR/NCSU research projects will be addressing the issue of what are appropriate technologies for: storing and cleaning the data; modeling the data; making the data secure; asking the right analysis questions; pre- and post-processing the data with regard to the analysis; and, finally, making the analysis results useful. The resulting techniques will be applicable across multiple industry sectors, including national security, health care, manufacturing, energy, and business intelligence. The research being done at NCSU will contribute to the computationally intensive analytics-research program of CHMPR, while complementing its portfolio by the NCSU big-data transformation and analysis expertise. The technologies and tools resulting from the proposed work will change the results that can be obtained from the data, as opposed to just obtaining the results faster. The ultimate success of this paradigm shift by the Big-Data-analysis industry will rest on the ability of universities such as NCSU to prepare experts in taking advantage of the data-enablement science and technologies to solve a variety of real-life applications."

    field_awardabstractText: 'The NSF I/UCRC Center for Embedded Systems (CES), was established in 2009 as a collaborative effort of Arizona State University (lead) and Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, to perform the industry relevant research for advancing the field of Embedded Systems (ES) hardware and software. It commenced its fifth year of operation of Phase I in Fall 2013. This proposal is for continuation of the CES as a Phase II I/UCRC. During Phase I, CES organized its research program into six main research topics, (1) Power, Energy and Thermal-Aware Design, (2) Electronic System-level (ESL) Design and Technologies, (3) Embedded Multicore Architectures and Programming, (4) Embedded Software Systems, (5) Cyber-Physical Systems, and (6) Integrated Circuit Technologies, Design, and Test. It has conducted fundamental, industry-relevant research, with 70 industry funded projects from 17 companies, involving average of 12.6 faculty, and 26.4 graduate students per year. Industry sponsored student internships have led 50 permanent, full time positions. In Phase II, CES will build upon the ongoing research efforts and cover new topics within these areas, and possibly re-balance its emphasis based on the existing and new industry partners, and additional faculty. Specifically, new projects are expected involving emerging nanotechnologies such as memristors and spintronic devices; a greater emphasis on energy harvesting techniques for ultra-low power systems; more projects addressing security and trustworthiness; design techniques and tools for guaranteeing provably correct behavior; and new computation paradigms that perform decision making in the presence of uncertainty. The research conducted at CES addresses many of the challenging problems posed by ES, the solutions to which can be applied to other design microelectronic system platforms. The multi-disciplinary nature of the work, and the diversity of the faculty expertise and the industrial partners will result in societal impact of CESs research outcomes. For instance, CES? work on improving the energy efficiency of ES hardware and software, improves and expands battery powered devices for medical applications and consumer electronics, and can also significantly improve the energy efficiency of high performance servers, thereby reducing the damage to the environment. Similarly, CES? work in verification of hybrid systems is being used to ensure that controls systems in automobiles will operate correctly. The same technologies will be used in all sorts of safety critical systems. CES? work on sensors for monitoring bridges is yet another example of the far reaching societal benefits of its research program. CES maintains a popular internship program at ASU for both undergraduate and graduate students. CES graduate students have learned the necessity and importance of explaining and justifying their work to industry members in a public forum with limited time and to an audience with varied backgrounds. This has made them and their work enormously more marketable to industry. Finally, both ASU and SIUC have successfully inducted outstanding female faculty, and CES will continue this effort in Phase II. In Phase II it is expected that at least one new site (Northeastern University) will be added to CES and continued efforts will be made to expand CES? industrial membership following a strong marketing plan that has been developed to achieve set targets. In addition, CES will explore the possibility of adding one or possibly two international sites: the University of Patras (UoP) in Greece, and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, India. UoP officials are expected to attend the January 2014 meeting of CES, and IISc has expressed interest in exploring ways to become a I/UCRC site, through their recently established Robert Bosch Center for Cyberphysical Systems.'

During Phase I, CES organized its research program into six main research topics, (1) Power, Energy and Thermal-Aware Design, (2) Electronic System-level (ESL) Design and Technologies, (3) Embedded Multicore Architectures and Programming, (4) Embedded Software Systems, (5) Cyber-Physical Systems, and (6) Integrated Circuit Technologies, Design, and Test. It has conducted fundamental, industry-relevant research, with 70 industry funded projects from 17 companies, involving average of 12.6 faculty, and 26.4 graduate students per year. Industry sponsored student internships have led 50 permanent, full time positions. In Phase II, CES will build upon the ongoing research efforts and cover new topics within these areas, and possibly re-balance its emphasis based on the existing and new industry partners, and additional faculty. Specifically, new projects are expected involving emerging nanotechnologies such as memristors and spintronic devices; a greater emphasis on energy harvesting techniques for ultra-low power systems; more projects addressing security and trustworthiness; design techniques and tools for guaranteeing provably correct behavior; and new computation paradigms that perform decision making in the presence of uncertainty. The research conducted at CES addresses many of the challenging problems posed by ES, the solutions to which can be applied to other design microelectronic system platforms. The multi-disciplinary nature of the work, and the diversity of the faculty expertise and the industrial partners will result in societal impact of CESs research outcomes. For instance, CES? work on improving the energy efficiency of ES hardware and software, improves and expands battery powered devices for medical applications and consumer electronics, and can also significantly improve the energy efficiency of high performance servers, thereby reducing the damage to the environment. Similarly, CES? work in verification of hybrid systems is being used to ensure that controls systems in automobiles will operate correctly. The same technologies will be used in all sorts of safety critical systems. CES? work on sensors for monitoring bridges is yet another example of the far reaching societal benefits of its research program. CES maintains a popular internship program at ASU for both undergraduate and graduate students. CES graduate students have learned the necessity and importance of explaining and justifying their work to industry members in a public forum with limited time and to an audience with varied backgrounds. This has made them and their work enormously more marketable to industry. Finally, both ASU and SIUC have successfully inducted outstanding female faculty, and CES will continue this effort in Phase II. In Phase II it is expected that at least one new site (Northeastern University) will be added to CES and continued efforts will be made to expand CES? industrial membership following a strong marketing plan that has been developed to achieve set targets. In addition, CES will explore the possibility of adding one or possibly two international sites: the University of Patras (UoP) in Greece, and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, India. UoP officials are expected to attend the January 2014 meeting of CES, and IISc has expressed interest in exploring ways to become a I/UCRC site, through their recently established Robert Bosch Center for Cyberphysical Systems.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and Signal/Power Integrity (SI/PI) problems can significantly decrease the reliability, increase the cost, and delay the development schedules of modern electronic systems. Design for EMC ensures an electronic system can function in the presence of external electromagnetic noise and at the same time its radiated electromagnetic interference does not impact the functionality of other devices.  SI/PI design ensures proper circuit operation at high speeds. Good EMC/SI/PI design is essential to industry for successful product development and customer satisfaction. The mission of the Center for Electromagnetic Compatibility is to support EMC/SI/PI research and education projects with a goal of developing the knowledge base, tools and people necessary to solve today''s EMC/SI/PI problems and address the EMC/SI/PI problems of the future. Advancing the EMC/SI/PI technologies has significant societal impacts in the internet and information era, and can significantly increase the economic competitiveness of the US. The research activities in the center can bring a disruptive advancement in the hardware level to the new technologies of 5G wireless, autonomous driving, smart city, etc., and can have profound impacts on human society and improve national security as our society is more dependent on data connection and internet of everything.  With emerging technology trends, the need for EMC/SI/PI research and education grows rapidly.  Not only new challenges occur due to higher data rates, greater design density, and lower power, but also new scopes are required to address the issues such as novel ways for high-frequency EMC measurements and hardware related security problems.  EMC becomes truly essential to enable and support technology revolutions and development. The NSF IUCRC Center for Electromagnetic Compatibility (CEMC) in Phase III will focus on five thrust areas: 1) EMI, ESD and Immunity; 2) Signal and Power Integrity; 3) Intra-System EMI and RF Desense; 4) Photonics-Based Microwave Measurement; and 5) Hardware Security, Safety and Trust.  Underlying noise physics and coupling mechanisms will be studied for various issues such as radiated electromagnetic interference, electrostatic discharge, radio-frequency interference, and hardware security.  Based on the gained understanding, engineering design tools, models and methodologies for achieving ESD-robust, immunity-enhanced, SI/PI-ensured, EMI and noise mitigated, safe and secured design will be investigated, developed, and dissimilated throughout the industry. The CEMC will continue serving as a resource center for the EMC community, facilitating research collaborations, disseminating results, and transferring knowledge.This award reflects NSF''s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation''s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.'

Catalysts are perhaps best known in automobile catalytic converters, but the same types of catalytic processes are responsible for commodity chemicals such as gasoline, textiles, and fertilizer and specialty chemicals such as pharmaceuticals.  It has been estimated that catalysis accounts for over 95% (by volume) of all products and over 80% of added value in the chemical industry.  About one third of the world?s economy depends directly or indirectly on catalysis.  In spite of their immense importance, the development of new heterogeneous catalysts is still largely empirical, which is to say, time-consuming and expensive, particularly at the stage of synthesis.  A grand challenge of catalysis is precisely the ?design and controlled synthesis of catalytic structures.? Our fundamental research in transforming catalyst synthesis from an art to a science will save tremendous amounts of time and energy in the development of new catalysts for petroleum, chemical and pharmaceutical companies as well as catalyst manufacturers.  Optimized catalysts allow chemical conversions to be achieved in the most efficient, economical, and environmentally responsible manner, reducing raw material usage, energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions.The Center for Rational Catalyst Synthesis (CeRCaS) will be the world?s first and only research center with the focus on understanding the chemical fundamentals of catalyst synthesis. CeRCaS will bring to bear powerful, complementary expertise at the University of South Carolina and Virginia Commonwealth University. The research projects which our industrial partners will help us select and refine are in three thrusts, first, The Fundamentals of Metal Deposition including in-situ observation of metal deposition mechanisms and a variety of methods for nanoparticle genesis, second, Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Solid-Solid Bonding, to be explored with theory and experiment to allow prediction of the wetting or sintering of metal oxides on support surfaces, and prediction of the size, shape and, in the case of bimetallics, composition of supported nanoparticles, and third, Precision Site Synthesis for Specific Reactions, in which nanoparticles will be synthesized with specific size, content (single or multi-metals) and morphology and so be optimized for particular catalytic reactions or to minimize the content of expensive precious metals.  Graduate students will be mentored with the practical mindset akin to an NSF Engineering Research Center.  This industrial bent will stem from two sources; first, internally, from VCU?s site Director (Gupton) and USC?s Deputy Director (Monnier) who hail from distinguished research careers in industry, and second, externally, from direct involvement of industrial research in individual research projects.  Educational outreach will include the recruitment and eventual industrial placement of underrepresented groups.  Both Universities have significant pools of women and minorities with whom to work.

    field_awardabstractText: 'This third phase of support for the Center for Child Injury Prevention Studies builds on a strong foundation that will, at the end of five years, transition into sustainability with the help of a broad base of industry and interested government agency support.  This Industry/University Cooperative Research Center is the only one devoted to the study of child, youth, and young adult automotive injury and injury prevention; and it applies its leadership position, cutting edge research, and synergistic partnerships to achieve its mission, by facilitating the conduct of scientific inquiry into child automotive injuries and translating these findings into commercial applications, interventions, policies, and public education programs for prevention. The fundamental idea behind the Center is that children, youth, and young adults are not small adults (mechanically, psychologically, developmentally, or socially) and car crash injuries are one of  their leading causes of death and acquired disability. Effective interventions, based on sound scientific foundations to car crash injuries in these age groups and their causes, are a national priority. As regulation, technology and consumer behavior and demand become increasingly complex and sophisticated, industry and government research and findings from the Center are able to guide strategies to protect our nation''s children.  The Center for Child Injury Prevention Studies works collaboratively with industry across five related themes: biomechanics; technological solutions; human factors; safety promotion and education; and evaluation; and over the course of the last ten years the Center has more than quadrupled its dues paying membership from 5 to 22 members, initiating and completing 92 individual research projects that heavily leverage private sector funds. Broader impacts of the Center include student education and engagement in research, promoting the national health by providing fundamental research on child injuries and strategies for prevention, and performing precompetitive research of interest to a wide variety of private sector and governmental sponsors.In this renewal phase (Phase III), Center leadership and its Industrial Advisory Board will continue to refine Center processes that they develop collaboratively to ensure that research carried out by the Center is diverse and responsive to scientific and industry needs. In the new phase, the Center is expanding its intellectual and research reach from automotive injuries and prevention to include those of injuries related to sports and aviation.'

Each year in the United States, over 1,500,000 children are occupants in motor vehicle crashes with close to 1,200 children sustaining fatal injuries, while more than 169,000 children are non-fatally injured, leading to substantial loss of productivity in the young.  CChIPS advances child safety through pre-competitive research and translation of engineering, behavioral and epidemiologic research findings into commercial applications, interventions, policies, and public education programs for prevention. Injury prevention involves reducing exposure to energy to levels below human tolerance limits and managing the injuries should they occur. Adult solutions are not appropriate for children who are not small adults - biomechanically, developmentally, and behaviorally and solutions need to dramatically change to accommodate growth and development. The research conducted by CChIPS is published in leading scientific and engineering journals and conferences and the results are cited as transformative regarding knowledge of how children, youth and young adults are injured and how to best protect them.  The Center for Child Injury Prevention Studies (CChIPS) is the nation''s only IUCRC focused on child injury prevention, with a specific emphasis on injury due to car crashes.  The mission of CChIPS is to advance the safety of children, youth, and young adults by conducting research focused on their injuries and translating the findings into commercial applications, interventions, policies, and public education programs for prevention.  The technical focus of the Ohio State CCHiPS site will include special emphasis on two areas: (1) crash test dummy development (2) public education and outreach.  Crash test dummies are an important safety tool used by manufacturers to design and tests child restraint systems (CRS), thus it is critical to continue to improve the dummies.  The main focus of the OSU site will be to continue to assist in improving the ability of the dummy to predict occupant safety, which will help lead to the development of better CRS for our children and youth.  Unfortunately, the benefit from improved CRS might be lost according to research showing that up to 75% of the seats are improperly installed. The OSU CChIPS site began a public outreach and education initiative to translate research findings and to promote child passenger safety to parents and caregivers. This initiative, called ?Buckle Up With Brutus? provides proper car seat usage information through its website (http://www.buckleup.osu.edu), social media, and community events.  Further research will be focused on this outreach program with a goal of reducing the misuse of CRS by parents and care givers.  The CChIPS Site at OSU, housed within the Injury Biomechanics Research Center (IBRC), brings together an interdisciplinary team of engineers, anatomists, physicians, and computer modelers who focus on both mechanisms of injury and injury thresholds of the human body. Until recently, the biomechanics research community did not have a deep understanding of the injury mechanisms and response of children and young adults to violent impacts experienced during a car crash. Child and adolescent crash test dummies used to estimate the severity of injury in such populations assumed that children and young adults were smaller versions of adults, thus making it difficult to improve protection for children in automobile crashes.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'The NSF IUCRC Center for Configuration Analytics and Automation (CCAA) addresses research issues related to the security, safety, and resiliency of information technology (IT) systems.  The PIs at Colorado State University (CSU) are engaged in cyber-security and resiliency of applications spanning multiple sectors, including health care, energy security, transportation security, and Internet of Things.  Complementing the IT security expertise of the existing CCAA Centers symbiotically, the current center will further strengthen the safety, security, and resiliency of IT and cyber physical systems thereby strengthening the nation''s critical infrastructure. The planned research projects of the Center promise significant societal benefits and is likely to attract minority students, specially women. In addition, some funds from this research will be used for outreach initiatives, reaching out to students at all levels including K12, and trying to increase the participation of minority students in STEM subjects. The project will also encourage the participation of minority-owned businesses in the Center.The University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) and George Mason University (GMU) jointly established the multi-university Center for Configuration Analytics and Automation (CCAA) under the aegis of the NSF I/UCRC Program in May 2013 to help commercial and government sectors improve security and resiliency of enterprise IT systems, cloud infrastructure, and cyber physical systems.  Configuration analytics and automation methodology and tools are being developed by the center so as to provide safety, security, and survivability of IT services and infrastructures.  The PIs at Colorado State University (CSU) have been focusing on problems related to securing and managing complex IT systems in the energy sector, health sector, transportation sector, the Internet of Things (IoT) and the next generation Internet infrastructure. The consensus is that challenges to IT security are many, the efforts are more often than not uncoordinated and piecemeal, the dawn of Internet of Things and increased sophistication of attackers are making it worse, and human interactions are bringing in an additional layer of complexity. Configuration analytics and automation in targeted application domains are more needed now than ever before to design effective solutions. Colorado State University (CSU) has teamed up with researchers and partners of the CCAA and established the CSU site of CCAA, to foster further synergistic activities that address the common need in many of these areas including security and resiliency of oil and natural gas plants, radar networks and IoT networks. Several industries have committed membership to the CSU site of CCAA and the CCAA team believes that such joint efforts in focused areas will make the nation even stronger in cyber defense and resiliency.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'With the increasing magnitude and sophistication of cyber attacks, cyber warfare has become a major threat to national security. However, the cybersecurity state of the art is still far from providing sufficient protection, not only for Internet enterprise services but also for critical infrastructure services, such as in the financial and energy sectors. With the exponential increase of attack surface and the complete reliance on human analysis and response, the time for detection and mitigation of cyber attacks have been significantly increasing (e.g., can take up to several months). In addition, the cost of deploying cybersecurity has been tremendously increasing as it is becoming very resource and labor intensive.  The University of North Carolina Charlotte (UNC Charlotte) is leading the research and industry community in NSF IUCRC Center on Cybersecurity Analytics and Automation (CCAA) to address these challenges. Our goal is to build the critical mass of inter-disciplinary academic researchers, industry partners, and government agencies for advancing the science and state-of-the-art of cybersecurity analytics and automation by developing innovative sense-making and decision-making capabilities for autonomous and adaptive cyber defense that requires minimal human involvement with provable and measurable security and resiliency properties.

    field_awardabstractText: 'The Center for Bioanalytic Metrology (CBM), a partnership between the University of Notre Dame, Indiana University, and Purdue University, advances U.S. competitiveness by working with industry to solve current, emerging, and industry-relevant challenges in measurement science and technology. The center has two over-arching objectives: (1) deliver best-in-class molecular measurement tools and expertise that enable the development of powerful new pre-competitive technologies and capabilities across the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, food/nutrition/agriculture, energy and analytical instrumentation sectors; and (2) serve as a proving ground for applications of new instrumentation to cutting-edge chemical and biochemical problems. Measurement science, and associated instrumentation, is a key contributor to the U.S. economy, enabling advances in everything from drug discovery to materials manufacturing. By bringing together companies in these high-technology sectors with major analytical instrument makers, the CBM bridges the gap between the initial demonstration of new ideas generated through collaboration between academia and industry and the delivery of practical pre-competitive knowledge that can drive technology development.

    field_awarddate: 05/09/2019
    field_awardabstractText: 'The goal of the Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites (CB2) is to improve the basic knowledge of the synthesis, processing, properties, and compounding of bioplastic and biocomposite materials, as well as to develop reliable material characteristics data for industrial partners and support large-scale industrial implementation of renewable materials. Sustainability is a rapidly growing aspect of technology, driven partially by social factors; however, many industries are struggling to effectively incorporate sustainability-related practices. CB2 creates new knowledge, materials, and processes for sustainable biobased plastics and composites. The vision of the center is to develop knowledge that will facilitate the production of an array of high-value products, including plastics, coatings, adhesives, and composites, from renewable feedstocks that are compatible with current industrial manufacturing systems and thereby promoting rural development as well as national growth. NDSU''s specific expertise in areas such as coatings technology and thermosetting polymers will be applied to the design of high performance biobased materials for use in coatings, composites, and adhesives. NDSU will also provide life cycle assessment and technoeconomic analysis to projects across CB2. The center focusses on the development of jobs in the area of sustainable manufacturing, focusing on conversion of agricultural and woody crops to energy and materials which are crucial to lasting job creation in the United States.  The center also strives to support education and diversity through engagement of K-12 educators, supporting a NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)  -- co-located at ISU and WSU -- where students participate in research on sustainable materials.The mission of the Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites (CB2) is to develop fundamental knowledge related to bioplastics and biocomposites, to disseminate research-based findings to industry to promote sustainability and to educate future scientists and engineers.

    field_awarddate: 11/06/2018
    field_awardabstractText: 'The Phase 1 award supports the establishment of a new Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) site at the University of Georgia to the existing Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites (CB2). CB2 currently includes Iowa State University, Washington State University, industry and government partners in the field. The University of Georgia site will provide additional capabilities for the center in the areas of new biodegradable polymers and additives, advanced fibers, and durable coatings and finishes based on biobased feedstocks.  Current members of CB2 will benefit from UGA faculty expertise and the research tools and infrastructure at UGA. Likewise, the Site at UGA will increase the opportunities to leverage research expertise and facilities at ISU and WSU, both of which have strong programs in sustainability, bioproducts, and bioplastics. Bringing a new synergistic industry sector to CB2 will benefit both incoming and current members by facilitating new industrial interactions spanning the bioproducts supply chain and enable CB2 members to lead their sectors in replacing existing plastic and packaging materials with biodegradable alternatives. Students will be educated and exposed to cutting edge research and outreach opportunities to enter the workforce immediately, with the ability to contribute and have positive impact. In 2014, global plastic production reached 299 million metric tons (MMTs), with 5 to 12 MMTs estimated to reach our oceans annually due to mismanaged waste (waste that is littered or not handled in an organized system like a landfill). With increasing population, plastic consumption, and waste generation, a cumulative input of up to 250 MMTs into our oceans is predicted by 2025. Of all the plastics manufactured today, about 40% are used in packaging, material that will be immediately thrown away after use. The packaging industry employs over 5 million people worldwide and has estimated sales of $1 trillion in 2018. The opportunities to replace persistent plastic materials with those that are compostable and or biodegradable are gaining market share in a variety of industry sectors.  The UGA site addition to CB2 is centered around replacing existing plastic and packaging materials with alternative, biodegradable or compostable plastics used in the packaging industry, including coatings, foams, nonwoven fibers, and novel thermoplastics with excellent barrier properties for films, sheet goods, and filtration media. As a Site addition to CB2, UGA will promote the IUCRC Center goals, including innovation in academia that is driven by industrial need. Plastics in the ocean is now recognized as a global issue, and industry is extremely interested in making changes in the design and production level to address the unintended consequences of non-biodegradable plastic. The work in this IUCRC will allow industry to innovate and collaborate at a critical time when scaling technologies is crucial to their success. Students will be educated and exposed to cutting edge research and outreach opportunities to enter the workforce immediately ready to contribute and have positive impacts.This award reflects NSF''s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation''s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'The Center for Advanced Non-Ferrous Structural Alloys (CANFSA) at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) consists of students, post-docs and faculty who work with their CANFSA counterparts at Iowa State University (ISU) to engage with scientists and engineers from both industry and government laboratories in research on the fundamentals of the physical and mechanical metallurgy of non-ferrous alloys (i.e., alloying and processing effects on microstructure, properties and performance). The motivation for CANFSA is to address the national decline in the training of students in this area that is critical to U.S. dominance in high performance materials, structures and advanced manufacturing. Today, there are only a few universities remaining who train students in these core science and engineering areas that are so critical to our industries, especially as National investments are made in new advanced materials and manufacturing strategies. In fact, these declines have greatly reduced; the synergies that existed previously between faculty, students, and the relevant industries, and this, in turn, significantly weakened the technical dominance of US industries that rely heavily&#8192; on these materials. CANFSA was organized to counter this trend by conducting fundamental scientific studies on these advanced materials and their manufacturing, thereby filling this critical workforce development gap and simultaneouslycontributing to U.S. global industrial competitiveness.The objective of CANFSA is to conduct critical basic and applied physical metallurgy;research of direct relevance to the industries that develop, manufacture and use advanced &#8192;non-ferrous structural alloys, and to train students in these important subjects. This is accomplished by engaging students in topics of importance to industry and government labs, and to have both faculty members and external mentors guide the students'' fundamental research. The specific details of the projects that are conducted within the Center vary as topics are selected that have the most direct relevance for the partners from industry and the national laboratories. To date, the Center has conducted leading research in the areas of: thermal and mechanical processing of non-ferrous alloys (e.g., 3rd Generation Al-Li alloys, texture anisotropy of Ti-6Al-4V); ultrafine grained alloys and their mechanical behavior (e.g., Ti and Mg); aging of high-strength beta-Ti alloys; processing of microeutectic Al alloys; microstructural evolution (e.g., Ni-Ti-Hf intermetallics, Ni-based superalloys, high entropy alloys); multi-layer coatings; lube-free die casting; and the role of trace elements and small microstructural variations on mechanical properties. To conduct these varied research projects and accomplish the goals of the Center, faculty members with complementary ;expertise in the areas of theory, modeling, processing and characterization are working together with members from industry and government laboratories. Mines has a variety of state-of-the-art processing and characterization tools that students, post-docs, and faculty use to address complex, yet precompetitive, projects that are of interest to a number of the our member companies. The expertise at Mines is complementary to that at ISU and, collectively, CANFSA is able to offer unique capabilities to its membership.'

    field_awarddate: 07/18/2016
    field_awardabstractText: 'The semiconductor industry is perennially one of America''s top exporters. Worldwide semiconductor sales for 2014 reached $335.8 billion, and the number of U.S. jobs in this sector was estimated to be around 250,000 in 2013. More broadly, the U.S. tech industry, which depends on semiconductor innovation to spur new products and applications, is itself estimated to represent no less than 5.7% of the entire U.S. private sector workforce (at nearly 6.5 million jobs), and with a tech industry payroll of $654 billion in 2014, it accounted for over 11% of all U.S. private sector payroll. Yet despite its success, the industry must continue to innovate if the U.S. is to retain global leadership in this highly competitive area. The complexity of modern microelectronic products necessitates the use of computer tools to formulate and verify product designs prior to manufacturing. When a product doesn''t operate as intended or suffers early failures, this can often be attributed to inadequacy of the models used during the design process. In fact, the shortcomings of existing approaches for system component modeling have become a serious impediment to continued innovation.The Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML) proposes to create machine-learning algorithms to derive models used for electronic design automation with the objective of enabling fast, accurate design of microelectronic circuits and systems. Success will make it much easier and cheaper to optimize a system design, allowing the industry to produce lower-power and lower-cost electronic systems without sacrificing functionality. The eventual result will be significant growth in capabilities that will drive innovation throughout the electronics industry, leading to new devices and applications, continued entrepreneurial leadership, and economic growth.While achieving those goals, CAEML will also focus on diversifying the undergraduate engineering student body and improving the undergraduate experience. Students from groups traditionally underrepresented in engineering will be targeted for recruitment as undergraduate research assistants. Member companies will provide internships and mentors for participating students, and the diverse graduate and undergraduate student researchers in CAEML will receive hands-on multidisciplinary education. CAEML will also participate in all three site universities? existing avenues for student and faculty engagement with local youth. In particular, university-based summer camps are a tried and tested method of making high-school students familiar with and comfortable on our campuses. NCSU runs engineering summer camps for high-school students, with the Electrical and Computer Engineering department providing an autonomous robotics workshop. CAEML undergraduate and graduate students can serve as counselors or instructors for camps; the CAEML team proposes to develop new activities and workshops for high-school campers on all three sites'' campuses. In addition, the MISO program (Maximizing the Impact of STEM Outreach) at NCSU is a campus-wide program funded by NSF that provides an innovative approach to evaluation across NC State''s K-12 STEM education outreach programsThe Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML) will create machine-learning algorithms to derive models used for electronic design automation, with the objective of enabling fast, accurate design of microelectronic circuits and systems. The electronics industry''s continued ability to innovate requires the creation of optimization methodologies that result in low-power integrated systems that meet performance specifications, despite being composed of components whose characteristics exhibit variability and that operate in different physical or signal domains. Today, shortcomings in accuracy and comprehensiveness of component-level behavioral models impede the advancement of computer-aided electronic system design optimization. The model accuracy also impacts system verification. Ultimately, the proper functionality of an electronic system is verified through testing of a representative sample. However, modern electronic systems are so complex that it is unthinkable to bring one to the manufacturing stage without first verifying its operation using simulation. Today, simulation generally does not ensure that an integrated circuit or electronic system will pass qualification testing the first time, and failures are often attributed to insufficiency of the simulation models. With an improved modeling capability, one could achieve better design efficiency, and also perform design optimization. For system simulation, behavioral models of the components'' terminal responses are desired for both computational tractability and protection of intellectual property. Despite many years of significant effort by the electronic design automation community, there is not a general, systematic method to generate accurate and comprehensive behavioral models, in part because of the nonlinear, complex, and multi-port nature of the components being modeled.CAEML will pioneer the use of machine-learning methods to extract behavioral models of electronic components and subsystems from simulation waveforms and/or measurement data. The Center will make 2 primary contributions to the field of machine learning: it will demonstrate the application of machine learning to electronics modeling, and develop the entire machine-learning pipeline. Historically, machine-learning theorists have focused on the model learning and evaluation tasks, but CAEML will focus on end-to-end performance of the pipeline, including data acquisition, selection and filtering, as well as cost function specification. CAEML will develop a methodology to use prior knowledge, i.e., physical constraints and the domain knowledge provided by designers, to speed up the learning process. Novel methods of incorporating component variability, including that due to semiconductor process variations, will be developed. The intended end-users are electronic design automation (EDA) tool developers, IC design houses, and system design and manufacturing companies.CAEML consists of 3 sites: Illinois, Georgia Tech, and NC State. The scope of research at each site encompasses both algorithm development and the application of the derived models to a variety of IC and system design tasks. Investigators at all 3 university sites have unique skills and expertise while sharing interests in electronic design automation, IC design, system-level signal integrity, and power distribution. To leverage the cross-campus expertise, many of the Center''s proposed projects involve investigators from more than one site. The NCSU investigators have special expertise in RFIC and digital design, process design kits, and circuit-level surrogate modeling. All three sites have strong research records in the fields of signal integrity analysis and electronic design automation.'

Yet despite its success, the industry must continue to innovate if the U.S. is to retain global leadership in this highly competitive area. The complexity of modern microelectronic products necessitates the use of computer tools to formulate and verify product designs prior to manufacturing. When a product doesn''t operate as intended or suffers early failures, this can often be attributed to inadequacy of the models used during the design process. In fact, the shortcomings of existing approaches for system component modeling have become a serious impediment to continued innovation.The Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML) proposes to create machine-learning algorithms to derive models used for electronic design automation with the objective of enabling fast, accurate design of microelectronic circuits and systems. Success will make it much easier and cheaper to optimize a system design, allowing the industry to produce lower-power and lower-cost electronic systems without sacrificing functionality. The eventual result will be significant growth in capabilities that will drive innovation throughout the electronics industry, leading to new devices and applications, continued entrepreneurial leadership, and economic growth.While achieving those goals, CAEML will also focus on diversifying the undergraduate engineering student body and improving the undergraduate experience. Students from groups traditionally underrepresented in engineering will be targeted for recruitment as undergraduate research assistants. Member companies will provide internships and mentors for participating students, and the diverse graduate and undergraduate student researchers in CAEML will receive hands-on multidisciplinary education. CAEML will also participate in all three site universities'' existing avenues for student and faculty engagement with local youth. In particular, university-based summer camps are a tried and tested method of making high-school students familiar with and comfortable on our campuses. The HOT DAYS @ Georgia Tech (https://www.ece.gatech.edu/outreach/hot-days)  camp is a week-long summer program designed to introduce high-school students to electrical and computer engineering concepts through various half-day modules including building a computer, working with robots, using music synthesis technology, building simple digital logic circuits and constructing a speaker from common household items. Additional modules covering CAEML research areas will be developed and incorporated into the camp''s schedule. CAEML undergraduate and graduate students can serve as counselors or instructors for camps. Georgia Tech''s Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing (CEISMC) hosts a variety of camps and programs for K-12 teachers, as well as students. CAEML faculty at Georgia Tech will participate in that effort as well as the NSF-funded Summer Teacher Experience in Packaging, Utilizing Physics (STEP-UP) Program (https://www.ece.gatech.edu/outreach/step-up-program), which is an eight-week research experience for metro Atlanta high-school physics teachers.The Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML) will create machine-learning algorithms to derive models used for electronic design automation, with the objective of enabling fast, accurate design of microelectronic circuits and systems. The electronics industry''s continued ability to innovate requires the creation of optimization methodologies that result in low-power integrated systems that meet performance specifications, despite being composed of components whose characteristics exhibit variability and that operate in different physical or signal domains. Today, shortcomings in accuracy and comprehensiveness of component-level behavioral models impede the advancement of computer-aided electronic system design optimization. The model accuracy also impacts system verification. Ultimately, the proper functionality of an electronic system is verified through testing of a representative sample. However, modern electronic systems are so complex that it is unthinkable to bring one to the manufacturing stage without first verifying its operation using simulation. Today, simulation generally does not ensure that an integrated circuit or electronic system will pass qualification testing the first time, and failures are often attributed to insufficiency of the simulation models. With an improved modeling capability, one could achieve better design efficiency, and also perform design optimization. For system simulation, behavioral models of the components'' terminal responses are desired for both computational tractability and protection of intellectual property. Despite many years of significant effort by the electronic design automation community, there is not a general, systematic method to generate accurate and comprehensive behavioral models, in part because of the nonlinear, complex, and multi-port nature of the components being modeled.CAEML will pioneer the use of machine-learning methods to extract behavioral models of electronic components and subsystems from simulation waveforms and/or measurement data. The Center will make 2 primary contributions to the field of machine learning: it will demonstrate the application of machine learning to electronics modeling, and develop the entire machine-learning pipeline. Historically, machine-learning theorists have focused on the model learning and evaluation tasks, but CAEML will focus on end-to-end performance of the pipeline, including data acquisition, selection and filtering, as well as cost function specification. CAEML will develop a methodology to use prior knowledge, i.e., physical constraints and the domain knowledge provided by designers, to speed up the learning process. Novel methods of incorporating component variability, including that due to semiconductor process variations, will be developed. The intended end-users are electronic design automation (EDA) tool developers, IC design houses, and system design and manufacturing companies.CAEML consists of 3 sites: Illinois, Georgia Tech, and NC State. The scope of research at each site encompasses both algorithm development and the application of the derived models to a variety of IC and system design tasks. Investigators at all 3 university sites have unique skills and expertise while sharing interests in electronic design automation, IC design, system-level signal integrity, and power distribution. To leverage the cross-campus expertise, many of the Center''s proposed projects involve investigators from more than one site. The Georgia Tech investigators have special expertise in advanced IC packaging, power integrity, multi-physics simulation, computational electromagnetics, neural networks, optimization and system integration. All three sites have strong research records in the fields of signal integrity analysis and electronic design automation. Excellent computational resources are available at Georgia Tech for the proposed work including extensive measurement and fabrication facilities.'

    field_awarddate: 08/22/2015
    field_awardabstractText: The University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK) site of the Center for Integrative Materials Joining Science for Energy Applications (CIMJSEA) seeks to close the gap between material development and weldability and to develop scientifically based methodologies for assessing material weldability and joinability that span from the nanometer to millimeter length scales over a wide variety of materials, while educating and developing a new generation of materials joining engineers and scientists.  The program seeks to identify&#8232; critical joining-related challenges to ensure alignment of research projects and to explore&#8232;the development of materials specifically tailored for manufacturing. Research will be relevant &#8232;to the future and existing manufacturing. The UTK site specialties include materials development, crosscutting capabilities that include multi-scale characterization&#8232;and modeling, as well as a new thrust area in additive manufacturing. The latter has the potential to benefit society in a multitude of ways including reducing scarce and dwindling raw materials.  Proficient new engineers will design by building layer-by-layer instead of by subtraction, allowing for unlimited possibilities in design complexity.  The program will reach out to a large age span of students, from elementary school onwards, by organizing and coaching younger students through LEGO league competitions, establishing and maintaining open 3D printing laboratories on campus, and by supporting Senior Capstone Design activities.  Technical efforts of the UTK site will foster innovations in welding, materials joining and&#8232;additive manufacturing technologies through interdisciplinary research, bringing together design, robotics and automation, process control, materials science, advanced characterization and high-performance computational modeling. The research at the UTK site includes large-scale additive manufacturing and joining polymer matrix composites&#8232;to metals.  In combination with existing joining technologies the efforts of the UTK site will create an environment where the development of hybrid material systems is accelerated and will be focused&#8232;on the scale-up of proven laboratory developments relevant to automotive, aerospace, and energy applications. The research will promote scientific discoveries related to the thermo-mechanical-chemical properties of interfaces between these constituent materials and advanced in situ and ex situ characterization techniques will be applied to understand issues such as cyclic thermal and&#8232;stress loading, residual stress development, and microstructural evolution. The end result will be a steady flow of fundamental research at the crossroads of joining and additive manufacturing.

    field_awardabstractText: The IUCRC for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS) site at the University of Washington (UW) proposes renewal for Phase II operation. CAFS and its sites address the problems and opportunities facing forestry that bridge disciplinary and regional boundaries, and require a broader and interdisciplinary approach that is the hallmark of universities. The center and its sites approach research questions on multiple spatial and temporal scales, including the molecular, cellular, individual-tree, stand, and ecosystem levels. The UW site will advance research in Phase II consistent with member needs such as it has done in Phase I in areas including 1) regional fertilization response of Douglas-fir, 2) growth and yield of improved Douglas-fir stock, and 3) use remote sensing to describe leaf area and root biomass of Douglas-fir plantations. Forests are vital to global ecological, social, and economic health. The research conducted by CAFS increases the competitiveness of forest products industries and forest landowners by solving problems on multiple temporal and spatial scales and determining fundamental solutions that transcend traditional species, regional, and disciplinary boundaries. Student training continues to be an important feature in Center research and technology transfer. These students are unique in the forestry sciences because of their problem-solving skills using interdisciplinary techniques across multiple scales. Recruiting for students among under-represented groups will be conducted, increasing the diversity of the workforce for both academia and industry in this traditionally diversity-deficient discipline.

    field_awardabstractText: Forest trees provide a wide range of traditional and advanced renewable materials including wood, paper, power, composites, polymers, and liquid fuels. Demand for these products is increasing due to population growth, increasing standards of living, and an increased recognition that forests will produce these products indefinitely if managers maintain the quality of soil in which trees are grown. Yet at as demand for renewable wood-based products increases, the commercial forest land base is shrinking.  Meeting increased demands for raw wood products from a shrinking land base requires increased production capacity through advanced forestry practices.  There is an important opportunity in the Inland Northwest (INW) where both the level of past investments and environmental constraints have limited gains in silvicultural systems. University of Idaho has joined nine other universities in the Center for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS) with the objective of educating a diversity of students to improve the productive capacity of our forests and meet societies increasing demand for future green, renewable products.Cooperative research links forest managers with universities to address a wide range of genetic and cultural problems.  INW forest land managers are faced with numerous questions about constrains on forest productivity and the productive capacity of our forests under intense management regimes.  The University of Idaho is uniquely situated in the region to address those questions in a rigorous and efficient manner.  Such collaborative research programs solve problems that are most relevant to local land managers.  Continued advancement requires work at the molecular to the ecosystems scales, and over an equally broad range of time scales considering the longevity of forest stand development.  CAFS allows regional cooperative research programs to take advantage of progress made nationally to collectively advance forestry systems nationwide.  Research will focus on increasing the carrying capacity of INW forests by studying the constraints to growth at high density and developing improved varieties for commercial reforestation. Recent advances in genomics may significantly shorten the tree breeding cycle allowing forest managers to apply genetic improvements to commercial forests much more quickly than previously possible. The exposure of industrial managers to a wider set of ideas leads to more rapid adoption of advanced technologies, which increases competitiveness of our forest products industries.

    field_awardabstractText: In Phase II operation, the University of Maine Site of the I/UCRC for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS) intends to focus on optimizing the silvicultural and genetic systems needed to produce high quality, raw materials thereby contributing to the cooperative research of the center and making significant progress in increasing forest productivity through forest genetics, site manipulation, and better growth & yield modeling.  Many of the problems and opportunities facing the management of forests today bridge disciplinary and regional boundaries.  To achieve the technological advances needed for new 21st century challenges, existing university/industry cooperatives must approach research questions at multiple spatial (including the molecular, cellular, individual-tree, stand, forest, and ecosystem levels) and temporal scales. Research conducted by the University of Maine site of CAFS increases the competitiveness of forest products industries and forest landowners. Industrial members benefit by becoming knowledgeable about a wider range of technological capabilities and technology transfer between CAFS scientists and member personnel fosters rapid implementation of new technologies. Students trained via CAFS research are unique in the forestry sciences because of their applied problem-solving skills using interdisciplinary techniques across multiple scales. Aggressive recruiting for graduate students among under-represented groups will continue to be conducted, increasing the diversity of the workforce for both academia and industry in this traditionally diversity-deficient discipline. Opportunities will continue to be sought to involve undergraduate students in CAFS research activities, exposing them to the excitement of forest science and encouraging them to pursue graduate education.

As CAFS moves into Phase III, focus will shift to address the technological challenges of the 21st century, with research questions aimed at multiple spatial and temporal scales (including molecular, cellular, individual-tree, stand, and ecosystem levels). Forests provide a major part of the Earth''s oxygen, remove and store a substantial amount of atmospheric CO2, provide habitats for much of the world''s plants, animals, and microorganisms, serve as feedstock for bioenergy, biofuels, and biomaterials, and are a source of economic opportunity. CAFS regional and national research on a wide range of technological capabilities to sustain healthy forests, with an emphasis on decision-support tools and remote sensing, will support the US forest industry by solving problems with targeted, applied, and collaborative research. The Center for Advanced Forestry Systems (CAFS) brings together industry and agency scientists and practitioners and university scientists to solve problems facing our nation''s planted and natural forests. CAFS Phase III interdisciplinary research approach will enhance the competitiveness of the U.S. forest products industries by solving problems at multiple temporal and spatial scales, and by determining fundamental solutions that transcend traditional tree species, regional, and disciplinary boundaries. During Phase III, CAFS will focus on precision forest management, forest genetics, key decision-support tools, and remote sensing research. Technology transfer between CAFS scientists and industry will facilitate the adoption of technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), which are rapidly changing how forests are measured, monitored, and managed. CAFS graduate students, recruited from underrepresented and traditional groups, will be unique in the forestry sciences because of their applied problem-solving and interdisciplinary skills across multiple scales. Healthy forests are vital to the world''s ecological, social, and economic health; wood is a major economic commodity that serves as the raw material for building and as a feedstock for bioenergy, biofuels, and biomaterials; and 2.7+ million jobs depend on forests, representing a payroll of over $110 billion. CAFS, as the leader for R&D relevant to the forest industry, will directly benefit the national forest economy.This award reflects NSF''s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation''s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'Age-related diseases are increasingly a leading cause of disability. Millions of younger adults live with neurological disorders, limb loss from amputation or paralysis from spinal cord injury. Traumatic brain injury can have lifelong effects on cognitive-motor function, significantly decreasing quality and length of life. There is a critical need for state-of-the art technology to effectively address the care and rehabilitation of these individuals. However, innovation in biomedical devices and other neurotechnologies faces several challenges: 1) The pace of innovation is moving more quickly than the rate of evaluation for acceptable performance; 2) Standards and regulatory science for the rigorous validation of safety, efficacy, and long-term reliability are missing; 3) Lack of open access to technologies that slows the transfer of novel technologies to the market; and 4) Current technologies are not affordable. To address these challenges, the University of Houston will partner with Arizona State University to establish and host a multi-institution Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (IUCRC) for Building Reliable Advances and Innovation in Neurotechnology (BRAIN).The BRAIN Center''s vision is a synergistic, interdisciplinary approach to develop and validate affordable patient-centered technologies.  BRAIN will leverage expertise in neural systems, cognitive and rehabilitation engineering, robotics, device development, clinical testing and reverse-translational research at the University of Houston and Arizona State University to 1) enhance the rate of development and empirical validation of new technologies through partnerships with industry leaders and other strategic partners; 2) develop standards and technologies in human and non-human models, using a multi-scale approach ranging from single neurons to organismal systems; 3) characterize innovative technologies such as biosensors and quantitative analysis tools for systems and behaviors; 4) evaluate the impact of these technologies on quality of life; and 5) reduce the cost of neurotechnologies. The BRAIN Center''s mission is multifold: to accelerate the progress of science and advance national health by transferring engineering innovations in neurotechnology to the end users, and to rectify underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields by broadening new participation and retaining current participants in STEM. It also will focus on problems in the neurological space that affect underrepresented groups disproportionately. BRAIN will become an innovative neurotechnology hub for the Southwest, creating a pipeline from discoveries to solutions while helping talented students, scientists, and engineers in the region take their innovations to the next level and solve one of the greatest unmet medical and health care needs of our time.BRAIN will leverage a unique concentration of researchers and innovative research and development ecosystems with industrial partnerships to design, develop, test, and characterize neural technologies that can effectively transform the lives of disabled individuals. The Center will investigate all levels of neural function to enhance not only current technologies but also understanding of the mechanisms underlying neurological disease and injury. The University of Houston IUCRC Site - a Hispanic-Serving Institution - will focus on multi-scale, multi-modal, and multi-disciplinary and noninvasive approaches to understanding all aspects of human neural function "in action and in context" in complex natural settings, and to deploying noninvasive technologies treating human disability. The University of Houston IUCRC site will bring a broad range of expertise spanning the spectrum of cognitive, affective, neural, and rehabilitation engineering across the human lifespan, big data analytics, computational modeling, wearable electronics, mobile brain-body imaging devices, intervention techniques including peripheral, brain-machine interfaces, smart human-machine systems, wearable robots, virtual and augmented reality and other noninvasive solutions.'

    field_awarddate: 04/02/2014
    field_awardabstractText: 'Texas Tech University (TTU) is proposing to be added as a site to the existing I/UCRC for Cloud and Autonomic Computing (CAC). TTU site will focus on cloud standards and standards-based software development innovation. It will extend and enhance the activities of the CAC in areas related to cloud computing best practices and standards research, including standards-based software, development and use of software stacks and reference implementations, and industry applications in real-world settings. TTU site will be working with the largest and most active of the computing-oriented Standards Development Organizations and vendors. The research effort will meet the industry need to organize, classify, develop reference implementations and contribute to the standards-based software in advanced distributed computing. Development of appropriate industry- and community-based consensus standards and application of these methods are required to exploit the capacity for transformative change provided by the new techniques for cloud and other advanced distributed computing. Without coordination on interface standards, algorithms and techniques, many potential advantages of these methods may be compromised due to a chaotic multiplicity of approaches, protocols and application programmer interfaces.The TTU site will leverage contacts with three outreach-oriented organizations with which the PIs are involved: (1) the TTU STEM Education & Outreach project for which the university has been nationally recognized; (2) by extensions of the existing High Performance Computing Center (HPCC) involvement in the SURAgrid regional grid and cloud computing educational dissemination project (including ongoing collaborations with the SURAgrid Virtual Organization and Cloud Computing Options Working Group); and (3) the High Performance Computing Across Texas (HiPCAT) organization, which concentrates on broadening access to grid and cloud computing in the physical sciences. The TTU HPCC and the PIs have extensive involvement with each of these programs. The site will develop an annual targeted workshop to integrate hands-on learning experiences for historically under-represented population groups into the projects that will be carried out during the performance period of this proposal, as well as activities to engage with the needs of selected non-profit organizations in areas in which they could benefit from the use of cloud computing. Texas Tech University has a number of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) educational outreach programs that overlap in the area of recruiting new students and in the mentoring of STEM students from underrepresented groups. The PIs will leverage these programs to strengthen their recruitment efforts.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'The explosive growth of IT and cloud infrastructures, coupled with the diversity of their components and a shortage of skilled IT workers, have resulted into systems whose control and timely management exceeds human ability.  The mission of the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Cloud and Autonomic Computing (CAC) is to advance the knowledge of how to design and engineer computing systems and applications that are capable of managing themselves, adapting their resources and operations to current workloads and anticipating the needs of their users. The CAC with three university sites (the University of Arizona, the Mississippi State University, and Texas Tech University) will lead research of innovative designs and programming paradigms for cloud and computing systems that can self-configure, self-heal, self-optimize and self-protect with minimal involvement of IT administrators or users. We are planning to involve the Auto Industry through the University of Detroit Mercy (UDM), who is an affiliated member with UA.  The CAC not only advances the science of autonomic computing but also accelerates its transfer to industry by closely working with industrial partners in the definition of projects pursued by the CAC, and contributing to the education of a workforce capable of designing and deploying cloud and autonomic computing systems. The CAC will involve students and faculty from underrepresented groups through several dissemination and recruiting initiatives at each site.Today''s IT and cloud infrastructures face significant management challenges that result from, among other factors, their distributed nature, their need to adapt to unanticipated demands, their heterogeneity, their size, large numbers of users and great complexity and diversity of IT and cloud services.  The mission of CAC is to engage academics, industrial and government partners in joint efforts that accelerate both our understanding of the fundamentals of cloud and autonomic computing, and the transfer of these fundamentals into industry solutions and education of a workforce capable of designing autonomic systems in general and cloud systems in particular. The CAC will conduct research on how to enable systems to be self-managed with respect to performance, fault, security, resilience, power consumption, etc. Unlike past attempts that address these properties in isolation, the CAC will endeavor to pursue integrated approaches that address more than one property. The technical scope of the Center?s activities includes design and evaluation methods, algorithms, architectures, software, mathematical foundations and benchmarks for cloud and autonomic systems. Solutions are studied for different levels of both centralized and distributed systems, including the hardware, networks, storage, middleware, services and information layers. The CAC solutions will focus more on self-management and security issues in Internet of Things (IoT), critical infrastructures and cloud systems and applications. The following are concrete examples of industry-relevant technical challenges that the CAC will address in the context of autonomic IT infrastructures: Automatic management of performance and energy consumption in large scale data centers and cloud systems; Securing and protecting the operations of sensors and actuators in IoT environments and their applications or services; Predictive modeling of quality-of-service of IT and cloud resources and applications; Dynamic resource provisioning and scheduling of computer resources; Autonomic management and protection of critical infrastructures; and Automation of system management operations of Internet of Things (IoT) resources and services.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'Phase I I/UCRC Clemson University Site: Advanced Mammalian Biomanufacturing Innovation Center (AMBIC).Johns Hopkins University, University of Delaware, Clemson University, and University of Massachusetts-Lowell have jointly established a multi-university, Phase I I/UCRC entitled the Advanced Mammalian Biomanufacturing Innovation Center (AMBIC).  Over the past two decades, the biopharmaceutical industry has emerged as one of the major manufacturing industries and engines of growth in the US economy.  Biomanufacturing represents nearly 2% of the total US GDP and its fraction is expanding. Much of biomanufacturing involves the use of cells to make medicines.  Examples of these types of medicines include cancer medicines and vaccines. A key element in developing these medicines is the need to establish complex manufacturing processes. AMBIC will implement engineering innovations to enhance the capabilities of our nation to manufacture these important life-extending and life-saving medicines.  Such improvements will improve the competitiveness of US biomanufacturing in coming decades leading to more economic investment by these companies and more jobs for American workers. The mission of AMBIC is to develop enabling technologies, knowledge, design tools and methods that apply and integrate high-throughput and genome-based technologies to fast-track advanced biomanufacturing processes.  AMBIC is the first I/UCRC dedicated to mammalian cell culture upstream development focusing on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the principal biopharmaceutical production host of industry.  AMBIC will bring together leading academic and industrial biotechnologists focused on mammalian cell culture manufacturing at a pre-competitive research level to address the complex problems in biopharmaceutical manufacturing.  This multi-university center will allow AMBIC to leverage the skills and the expertise of many faculty members across the Sites.  AMBIC will be a critical catalyst towards maintaining national excellence in biopharmaceutical production by conducting research in: 1) Understanding Industrially-Relevant Biology (e.g., all -omics, bioinformatics, process and product quality, etc.); 2) Process Monitoring & Control (e.g., analytics, instrumentation, data mining and modeling); 3) Consensus and Standardization Issues (e.g., standards, simple fingerprints, raw material issues, regulatory issues, forensic bioprocessing, clonality).  Through systems-level biology analysis, novel cell line development, bioreactor optimization, and advanced analytics, AMBIC will provide transformative solutions that can lower biomanufacturing costs and improve bioprocessing efficiency.  Most importantly, these advances may ultimately serve to make more biopharmaceuticals available to patients that need them and lower overall health care costs for consumers.  In addition, AMBIC will establish and maintain a pipeline of educated and motivated students at multiple levels for careers in biopharmaceutical manufacturing and development.  Collaborations with corporate partners will enable the students to work on the most pressing problems that the industry faces.  Furthermore, this center will serve to engage and excite students from under-represented minority populations to pursue a career in life sciences, engineering, or related STEM fields.  An important part of the AMBIC activities and a committed goal of the PI''s is to increase the participation of women and under-represented minorities in STEM disciplines by energizing students from all backgrounds about the exciting opportunities to help others through STEM careers in biotechnology and biomedicine.'

    field_awarddate: 11/26/2018
    field_awardabstractText: 'Biopharmaceuticals, such as insulin or cancer-targeting antibodies, are life-saving medicines that are ''bio''manufactured from biological sources, including genetically-modified living cells. Importantly, these complex molecules cannot be manufactured by automated synthetic chemical processes. Instead, they can be biomanufactured by cells optimally grown in bioreactors. The Advanced Mammalian Biomanufacturing Innovation Center (AMBIC) is developing enabling technologies, knowledge, design tools and methods that fast-track advances in biomanufacturing. AMBIC is an industry-led consortium of companies, academic institutions, and federal agencies that is addressing biomanufacturing-related challenges by injecting solutions that enhance speed, reliability, predictability, and product quality (including safety and efficacy), while maintaining flexibility and potentially lowering cost. There are three main research thrusts within AMBIC: (i) understanding industrially-relevant biology so that manufacturing practices can leverage this emerging knowledge to control biological processes for optimal biopharmaceuticals production, (ii) advanced process monitoring and control systems that enable streamlined and effective manufacturing operations, and (iii) creating consensus industry-wide best practices and standards to most effectively utilize manufacturing inputs so that products will readily pass regulatory inspection and review. In this way, the health and security of the US are positively impacted.     As AMBIC investigators develop new and enhanced production processes, cell lines, cell growth media, and process analytical technologies, a state-of-the-art bioprocessing suite within the University of Maryland (UMD) Site and joint with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will be used as a recognized testbed. AMBIC researchers will also work with Maryland''s Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (M-CERSI), a regulatory science research center joint with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Scores of biopharmaceuticals companies have biotherapeutics products that are regulated by the FDA and rely on standards and measurements enabled by NIST. The UMD Site helps to integrate these federal agencies into the AMBIC center. The UMD Site will also bring powerful new analytical methodologies including wireless real time process data acquisition and in situ product measurement tools for embedding into advanced reactor control methodologies. Perhaps most importantly, a diverse set of students from a variety of academic backgrounds (chemistry, materials science, chemical and bioengineering, process control) working to advance manufacturing practice will be readily accepted by the industry and will be the catalyst for its future. As AMBIC grows, owing to many participants throughout the US working together to chart the future, it will be a focal point for U.S. biomanufacturing for the next two decades.This award is co-funded by the following Programs:Cellular & Biochemical Engineering Program in the Division of Chemical Biochemical Environment and Transport (CBET) - Engineering (ENG) Directorate.Systems and Synthetic Biology Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) - Biological Sciences Directorate .This award reflects NSF''s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation''s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'The Center for Science of Heterogeneous Additive Printing of 3D Materials (SHAP3D) will serve the diverse interests of industry, government, and academia to address fundamental research challenges to meet the commercial needs of industry for heterogeneous 3D printing of materials. Additive manufacturing (AM) is viewed as a research area for global competitive advantage by industries such as automotive, medical, aerospace, and consumer products. SHAP3D aims to accelerate expansion and competitiveness of the domestic AM industry and its customers by addressing two critical market needs: (1) the growth of AM into more complex topologies, heterogeneous, and multi-functional applications that command high margins commensurate with their increased performance, and (2) the expansion of AM into lower margin industries via order-of-magnitude improvements in throughput, material-per-performance cost reductions, and ease-of-use design rules that enable SMEs and large companies to rapidly adopt advanced techniques. The Center will disseminate its design, material and process research to industrial members and practitioners, and the broader academic community. SHAP3D will provide a technically trained workforce, with industrial perspective, through the close collaboration between industry and academia. UCONN site''s educational activities include summer programs for high school students and teachers, outreach to minority graduate students, and certificate programs in additive manufacturing.The SHAP3D research will be driven by the performance requirements of industry, built from a technical foundation of the fundamental structure-processing-property relationships associated with the voxel-level control and integration of diverse processes and materials. The enormous number of material combinations possible in these multi-material systems multiplied by the parameter space represented within processes with voxel-level state-variable control requires fundamental understanding of the material (constituents, fillers, interfaces) properties, processing protocols, and design rules to reliably predict the properties of products. Despite the diverse materials and process combinations, they are unified by many underlying physical principles related to melting, processing, and solidification, and interfacial physics for heterogeneous additive printing of materials. The Center will support members'' choice of AM methods and research that encompasses numerous additive printing methods, such as fused filament fabrication (FFF), stereolithography/digital light processing (SLA/DLP), ink-jet, and other additive approaches. UCONN will leverage its strengths and will focus on three thrust areas: (i) automation, (ii) integrating polymers with non-polymers, and (iii) bio-printing. The Center and UCONN-site will add significant value for industry by addressing their vision to additively manufacture dissimilar materials into heterogeneous, valued-added products imbued with previously unattained biological, chemical, electrical, and mechanical functionality.This award reflects NSF''s statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation''s intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'Separation and purification processes are essential to production of biochemicals, biopharmaceuticals, chemicals, drugs, food products, gaseous/liquid fuels, healthcare products, metals, potable water, semi-conductor chips among others. Membrane-based separation/purification processes are becoming increasingly important in manufacturing such products. A membrane allows selective transport of one species from one phase on one side of the membrane to another phase on the other side of the membrane; often a membrane acting as a barrier selectively blocks one or more species from going through (e.g., membrane-based protective clothing against toxic gases). The species may be molecules in gaseous/liquid phase, ions in solution, macromolecules, nanoparticles, micron-size particles. Membrane devices and processes are favored due to lower energy consumption (e.g., desalination), easy scale-up (e.g., natural gas purification), smaller footprint (e.g., membrane contactors) and are the only viable option in kidney dialysis. The New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) site of the Membrane Science, Engineering and Technology Center (MAST Center) is focused on solving specific separation problems by developing advanced membranes and characterizing such membranes and processes. NJIT site provides advanced education, training and research opportunities to students and young researchers on research topics specified by MAST Sponsors: industrial corporations, national laboratories and federal agencies.The MAST Center is a multi-university-based industry-university cooperative research center with three university sites. Guided by members of the industrial advisory board (IAB), MAST Center 1) conducts fundamental research in membranes via innovative materials and processes facilitating the use of membrane technology for current/emerging industrial applications; (2) sustains technological leadership in membrane materials and membrane-based separation processes and facilitates commercialization of innovative technologies; and (3) provides undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows with a relevant educational and research experience. The Center-spanning research themes aligned with IAB interests are: water treatment, bioseparations, membrane fabrication and characterization, organic solvent processing, gas separations, barrier membranes. NJIT''s MAST Center faculty from four academic departments have their research focus on water treatment, barrier membranes, organic solvent-based system processing and membrane characterization. Research thrust areas of special interest to NJIT MAST faculty are: water treatment membranes for desalination, industrial effluent treatment and recovery of chemicals and metals by novel membranes, organic solvent-based system processing with solvent-resistant membranes, barrier membranes for chemical and biological protection.

The goal of this research is to enable security and software technology gains within member organizations.  Virginia Tech''s site specifically focuses on challenges with software and security for cyber-physical systems, with a particular emphasis on the emerging areas of critical infrastructure and the Internet of Things.  Addressing security and privacy challenges with these technologies are critical to protecting homeland security and preserving civil liberties in an increasingly interconnected world.  Research executed through this program will be principally funded by industry partners who join the consortium as members, with the goal of developing commercialization paths for resulting innovation.  Additionally students who will be supported on projects will gain insight into real-world problems of direct interest to industry, and will forge relationships that can lead to recruiting and future career placement in an increasingly competitive technology discipline.Ultimately the specific technical problems tackled and approaches considered will be determined by the Industry Advisory Board (IAB) who provides governance for S2ERC.  However Virginia Tech seeks to focus on recruiting and sustaining members with a specific interest in the security and privacy challenges with cyber-physical systems.  Given the experience of the faculty and researchers involved, research undertaken is expected to leverage deep expertise in security for embedded systems, control systems, and wireless systems.  Within the embedded systems domain, we will develop and leverage tools in program analysis and software synthesis to develop provably safe and secure firmware for embedded devices.  For control systems we will seek to translate functions typically found in the defense of computer networks into components used in embedded control networks to detect and block anomalous control signaling.  Within the wireless area, we seek to ensure resilience within networks such that attempts to disrupt wireless infrastructure have minimal effect on critical functions using the network.  With the umbrella of the larger center, we seek to synthesize these concepts into tools and techniques that can transcend each in order to address security overall for systems and systems of systems.  Lastly we seek to understand the human element in these cyber-physical systems and work to ensure security technologies integrate with the user experience and are effective in real-world deployments.'

    field_awardabstractText: 'Georgetown University will be joining as a full site the Security and Software Engineering Research Center (S2ERC) I/UCRC. S2ERC is a multi-university center comprised of Ball State University (lead institution), Iowa State University, and Virginia Polytechnic University. The proposed Georgetown site will bring complimentary capabilities in forensics, advanced cryptography, privacy, provenance, security, and governance to the S2ERC. Particular programs include cyber threat intelligence exchange; secure network interoperability; tailored trustworthy spaces for secure communications; social, behavioral, and economic impediments to inter-enterprise communication; law and inter-enterprise communication; novel architectures and algorithms of zero-knowledge action on secret information; novel key distribution and access algorithms; and technologies for cyber threat intelligence sharing. Information sharing is a key focus for the technologies developed by the Georgetown site. Information sharing compliments the software engineering work and the use of software engineering for the development of secure software systems by Ball State and Iowa State as well as the low-level hardware, radio security, and computer engineering work done by Virginia Tech. Technology contributions from the center will include: (i) Trust negotiation tools and data trust models to support the negotiation of policy, (ii) Data protection tools, access control management, monitoring and compliance verification mechanisms to allow for informed trust of the entire transaction path, and (iii) Resource and cost analysis tools. Some of the affiliates of Georgetown site are product companies which are expected to directly benefit from the results of the proposed research projects. This will make them more competitive and position them well in the global marketplace. Some of the proposed research, particularly in cyber security, will result in new educational curriculum and the training of much needed security specialists. The PI''s will make effort to involve students from other disciplines, especially those that traditionally have a better track record at attracting non-traditional student demographics, and expose them to certain elements of the Computer Science. This will facilitate the engagement of larger student population with computer science discipline. All the students engaged in the program will benefit from the industry exposure and technology transfer. The Georgetown site currently engages female and minority professors, researchers, and students, as well as students from K-12. This engagement will be further strengthened by the formation of the I/UCRC site.'
