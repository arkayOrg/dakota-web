        <h2 id="">Program Income (for awards made after January 2016)</h2>

        <p>Cost-sharing is no longer a requirement. Membership fees received by the Center are considered program
          income. At least 90% of the IUCRC program income must be used to support direct costs of the research, and up
          to 10% may be used to support indirect costs. Any unexpended program income remaining at the end of the grant
          must be remitted to NSF by crediting costs otherwise chargeable against the grant or if that is not possible
          returned to the NSF. Membership fees cannot be transferred from Phase to Phase but can be spent if a no cost
          extension is requested while NSF funds are still available.</p>

        <p>The 2014 Proposal and Award Policies and Procedures Guide (PAPPG) requires that all awardee organizations
          submit a Program Income Reporting Sheet. Reporting instructions and Reporting Sheet are found&nbsp;<a

        <h2 id="">Cost-sharing (for awards prior to January 2016)</h2>

        <p>NSF issued a revised version of the&nbsp;<a
            href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf15001/index.jsp">Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp;
            Procedures Guide (PAPPG), (NSF 15-1)</a>&nbsp;which became effective for all proposals submitted or due on
          or after December 26, 2014. In addition, existing awards that receive a funding increment on or after December
          26, 2014 are subject to NSF 15-1 and to the&nbsp;<a
            href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/gc1/dec14.pdf">NSF Grant General Conditions (GC-1)</a>&nbsp;which
          will be incorporated by reference into that funding amendment.</p>

        <p>The PAPPG is comprised of documents relating to the Foundation's proposal and award process, including
          guidance on the preparation and submission of proposals to NSF and guidance on managing and monitoring the
          award and administration of grants and cooperative agreements made by the Foundation.</p>

        <p>The PAPPG, in conjunction with GC-1, serves as the Foundation's implementation of 2 CFR ยง 200, Uniform
          Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance). In
          addition to the significant changes to implement the Uniform Guidance, the PAPPG contained other important
          revisions and updates.</p>

        <p>Please note that one significant change relates to required cost sharing reports. NSF now requires that
          awards with any mandatory cost sharing must document such cost sharing (on an annual and final basis), the
          Authorized Organizational Representative must certify that the amount is correct, and the cost sharing must be
          reported to NSF via use of NSF's electronic systems.</p>

        <p>Step by step instructions for completing and submitting the required annual cost sharing report are
          found&nbsp;<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/universities/solicitation/annual-costs">here</a>. Please note that for existing awards
          that received a funding increment on or after December 26, 2014, NSF has entered "Administrative"
          certifications so that you do not need to submit prior certifications. You will only need to provide a
          certification for the most current period.</p>

        <p>The Federal-wide requirements related to cost sharing can be found in&nbsp;<a
            href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&amp;SID=03a151b321d82f405976f095ce20d191&amp;n=pt2.1.200&amp;r=PART&amp;ty=HTML#se2.1.200_1306">2
            CFR ยง 200.306 "Cost Sharing or Matching." Chapter II.C.2 of the NSF Grant Proposal Guide (GPG) (Part I of
            the PAPPG) and Chapter II.C of the NSF Award and Administration Guide (AAG) (Part II of the PAPPG) provide
            information about NSF's cost sharing policies and requirements. Article 29 of GC-1 outlines grant conditions
            for cost sharing and cost sharing records</a>.</p>

        <p>Please keep in mind the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Although annual reports are now required, the cost sharing commitment on Line M of the NSF-approved budget
            must only be met by the end of the award.</li>
          <li>Funding from another Federal agency cannot be used to meet the mandatory cost sharing commitment.</li>
          <li>Failure to meet the mandatory cost sharing commitment may result in the disallowance of some or all of the
            costs charged to the award; the subsequent recovery by NSF of some or all of the NSF funds provided under
            the award; and/or possible termination of the award.</li>
        </ul>
