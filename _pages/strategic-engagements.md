      <p>Industryâ€“University Cooperative Research Centers support areas of strategic interest to industry, offering
        resources to develop faster paths to infusion of new technologies. Industry and government agencies can
        participate as Center members or by partnering directly with NSF at the strategic level to inspire new areas of
        research.</p>

      <p>NSF seeks partners from industry and government to formulate new Center concepts and engage teams to solve
        research challenges across disciplines.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Federal agencies: Representatives of federal agencies should contact us about the possibility of working
          with university researchers who are interested in translating their research and forming new broad,
          multidisciplinary Centers.</li>
        <li>Industry: Senior industry leaders responsible for strategic research should contact us about partnering with
          academic communities who seek to guide the creation of use-inspired research.</li>
