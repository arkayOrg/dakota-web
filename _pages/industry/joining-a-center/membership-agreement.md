          (“Center Software”). The parties agree that they will not pursue patent protection for such software.
          Therefore, each party understands and agrees that if it wishes to utilize any Center Software created solely
          by the other party, it can obtain and use such Center Software under the terms of the Apache X.Y license.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><span>Option 2:</span><span>&nbsp;Public Domain Operation. The Agreement (below) with Clauses E, and F
              removed and Clause E replaced with the following clause:</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>E. Activity of the center funded all or in part by center membership fees will be in the public domain upon
          completion and publication review by members.</p>

        <p>Note: If the IUCRC is comprised of a single university site, the word UNIVERSITIES in the agreement must be
          replaced with UNIVERSITY.</p>
