        <p>NSF has specific statutory authority that authorizes other Federal Agencies to transfer funds to NSF and NSF
          to use those funds to provide support to scientific and engineering research or education. NSF recommends that
          agencies use this provision of the&nbsp;<a href="https://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/81-507.pdf">NSF Act of
            1950</a>&nbsp;as amended (42 USC 1861-75) as the statutory authority for the transfer of funds for IUCRCs.
        </p>

        <p>Membership fees received via IAA are paid to the university via supplemental funding to an existing NSF
          grant. IUCRC grants are awarded via a competitive peer review process at NSF which eliminates the need for
          other federal agencies to hold a competitive procurement process.&nbsp;<strong>NSF cannot change the terms and
            conditions of the grant</strong>&nbsp;as a result of the IAA. Because NSF grants are not contracts, but are
          financial assistance awards,&nbsp;<strong>IAAs cannot be accepted that have acquisition or contractual
            requirements outlined or embedded in them, such as deliverables or reporting at intervals other than those
            of the original award.</strong></p>

        <p>In order to process your IAA request in a timely manner, you must know:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The center you want to join;</li>
          <li>The university receiving your membership; and,</li>
          <li>The cost of the membership.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><em>Please note that NSF will not process IAA for centers approaching the end of their award or in No-Cost
            Extension status. It is incumbent upon you to ensure that the IUCRC you are trying to join is eligible to
            receive NSF supplemental funding to its NSF award.</em></p>

        <h2 id="">Preparation Instructions</h2>

        <p>The following items should be sent via email, to the IUCRC Interagency processing team at:&nbsp;<a

          help expedite initial processing and facilitate follow-up.</p>

          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="">Billing</h2>

        <p>When funds from an IAA are applied to an NSF grant, billing must be cost reimbursable, and payment will be
          done via IPAC (Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection System) notification.<br><br>
          Occasionally, an obligated IAA may not have been billed and invoiced by the university and thus NSF is unable
          to bill the other agency. The university is responsible to ensure that the following steps have taken place:
        </p>

        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>Requesting agency: Notifies both NSF (<a
              href="mailto:iucrcinteragency@nsf.gov">iucrcinteragency@nsf.gov</a>) and the University that there is an
            outstanding amount against the IAA;</li>
          <li>University: Informs&nbsp;NSF's Cash Management Section&nbsp;that the amounts under the IAA have been
            expended; and,</li>
          <li>NSF's Accounting Operations Branch: Receives report from the Cash Management section and submits an
            invoice to the requesting agency.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2 id="">Submission Deadline Notice</h2>

        <p>To ensure obligation of funds prior to the end of the fiscal year, IAAs should be submitted to the NSF IUCRC
          program&nbsp;<strong>no later than July 1</strong>. All submissions sent after that date will be returned to
          the submitting agency if funds are due to expire at the end of the Fiscal Year. Submissions sent after the
          deadline can be held over until the new fiscal year if the funds are not due to expire until the end of the
          new fiscal year.</p>

        <p><strong>Timelines</strong></p>

        <ul>
          <li>15 to 30 days - to process an agency IAA request once NSF receives a complete and accurate IAA package as
            outlined in the Preparation Instructions above.</li>
          <li>10 to 30 days after the IAA documents are processed - to process an IUCRC's request to obtain the funds
            coming from an agency.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Additional Information</strong><br>
