        <p><strong>When:</strong>&nbsp;Technically the report is due 90 days before the award expiration date. However,
          to assure that your funds are readily available, it is strongly advised that your report be submitted on or
          before July 1 for the following fiscal year. Processing and other delays could push the process back and delay
          your receipt of continued funding if not submitted by July 1.</p>

        <p><strong>Where:</strong>&nbsp;Research.gov must be used to submit your annual report.</p>

        <p><strong>Why:</strong>&nbsp;To assure that you have timely continued funding on your award.</p>

        <p><strong>Essential Information:</strong>&nbsp;You must submit an annual report if you receive any funds from
          NSF as a partner institution. Note that you can copy and submit the same information as provided by the lead
          institution.</p>

        <p><strong>How:</strong>&nbsp;Please follow reporting instructions found on research.gov or by accessing the
          following link:&nbsp;<a

            Instructions</a>.</p>

        <p>Please make sure to enter content of your report in the various sections. You may upload PDF files with
          images, tables, charts, specific research project updates in support of each section. The SRO signed
          membership certification for the reporting period compiled using the following template:&nbsp;<a

        <h2 id=""><span class="highlight">Center Structural Data Reporting</span></h2>
        <p>In addition to the annual report, centers are required to provide data to NSF and its authorized
          representatives (contractors or grantees). These data are used for NSF internal reports, to look at historical
          trend, and for securing future funding for continued IUCRC program maintenance and growth. Data that a given
          center provides as well as aggregate data across all centers is available to that center as a management tool.
          Updates by centers to their structural data in the IUCRC database are required annually. Data for the last
          complete fiscal year should be submitted via the mechanisms provided by NSF or its contractors no later than
          September 30. Centers are responsible for submitting this information after the award expires for their final
          fiscal year of activity. These indicators are both quantitative and descriptive.</p>
