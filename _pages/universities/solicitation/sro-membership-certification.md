            Membership Certification Form</a>&nbsp;<strong>printed on Institutional Letterhead and physically signed by
            the SRO Administrator</strong>. The document should also contain the SRO's formal title and printed name and
          date. The "Others" section of the form is optional. If a grant is in a no-cost extension period, the SRO
          should add columns to the table to accommodate the additional years. An SRO may provide the information for
          multiple sites on one form, provided that it is clear which membership information applies to which Site.</p>

        <p><strong>What to report:</strong>&nbsp;For the purpose of the NSF certification of memberships, the SRO must
          list the companies that had executed membership agreements during the NSF reporting period and started paying
          their membership during that year. If membership fee is paid in installments, SRO must indicate the total
          amount of level purchased but flag it by indicating the amount received during the reporting period (see
          examples). Do not not report payments of installments carried over from memberships executed in previous NSF
          reporting periods.</p>

        <p>The SRO membership certification reports memberships in any given award year, not payments or expenditures on
          projects.</p>
