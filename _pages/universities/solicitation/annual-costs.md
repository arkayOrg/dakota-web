        <p>Only an SPO may prepare a Cost Sharing Notification.</p>

        <p><em>If an award involves cost sharing,</em>&nbsp;the amount of cost sharing is reflected on line M of the
          approved budget. Consistent with the guidance in 2 CFR 200.306, the commitment of these funds is legally
          binding and is subject to audit.</p>

        <p>NSF must ensure annual certification of awards with cost sharing as outlined in the Award and Administration
          Guide (AAG) Chapter II.C.2. and 3.<br>
          The notification&nbsp;<em>must</em>&nbsp;contain:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The start and end dates of the reporting period</li>
          <li>The amount of cost sharing for the current reporting period</li>
          <li>The cumulative amount of cost sharing reported to date, including the amount of cost sharing for the
            reporting period</li>
          <li>The cost sharing notification type (annual or final)</li>
          <li>An explanation for the cost sharing</li>
        </ul>
